anarchism is political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary coercive forms of hierarchy anarchism calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful it is usually described alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing libertarian socialism of the socialist movement and as having historical association with anti capitalism and socialism the history of anarchism goes back to prehistory when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states realms or empires with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies scepticism toward authority also rose but it was not until the th century that self conscious political movement emerged during the latter half of the th and the first decades of the th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had significant role in workers struggles for emancipation various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism in the last decades of the th century and into the st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more anarchism employs diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics there is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state having taken violent turn in the past evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like anarchist thought criticism and praxis have played part in diverse areas of human society criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent violent and utopian etymology terminology and definition wilhelm weitling an example of writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without ruler composed of the prefix an without and the word arkhos leader or ruler the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy anarchism appears in english from as anarchisme and anarchy from early english usages empahised sense of disorder various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists many revolutionaries of the th century such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but they did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid th century since the and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as synonym for anarchism and its use as synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups including both the new left and libertarian marxists who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or vanguard party as well as extreme liberals primarily concerned with civil liberties additionally some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchism negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism matthew adams and carl levy write that anarchism is used to describe the anti authoritarian wing of the socialist movement noam chomsky describes anarchism alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing of socialism daniel guérin wrote anarchism is really synonym for socialism the anarchist is primarily socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the state while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently hence it might be true to say that anarchism is cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organisation including capitalism nationalism the state and all associated institutions in the conduct of all human relations in favour of society based on freedom and voluntary association however this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti which is an posteriori conclusion anti statism anarchism is much more than that and etymology which is simply negation of ruler nonetheless major elements of the definition of anarchism include the will for non coercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such non coercive society and suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy herbert osgood claimed that anarchism is the extreme antithesis of authoritarian communism and state socialism peter marshall states that in general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp but it also has outriders in liberalism it cannot be reduced to socialism and is best seen as separate and distinctive doctrine according to jeremy jennings it is hard not to conclude that these ideas referring to anarcho capitalism are described as anarchist only on the basis of of what anarchism is jennings adds that anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual as the anarcho capitalists appear to believe but as we have already seen for the extension of individuality and community nicolas walter wrote that anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically in sense anarchists always remain liberals and socialists and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself we are liberals but more so and socialists but more so michael newman includes anarchism as one of many socialist traditions especially the more socialist aligned tradition following proudhon and mikhail bakunin brian morriss argues that it is conceptually and historically misleading to create dichotomy between socialism and anarchism history pre modern era zeno of citium bc whose republic inspired peter kropotkin during the prehistoric era of mankind an established authority did not exist it was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as reaction most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece in china philosophical anarchism the discussion on the legitimacy of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi alongside stoicism taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience cynics dismissed human law nomos and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature physis stoics were supportive of society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of state during the middle ages there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the muslim world or in christian europe this kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad in basra religious sects preached against the state in europe various sects developed anti state and libertarian tendencies libertarian ideas further emerged during the renaissance with the spread of humanism rationalism and reasoning through europe novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based on voluntarism rather than coercion the age of enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress modern era during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enragés and the saw turning point in the fermentation of anti state and federalist sentiments the first anarchist currents developed throughout the th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimising the state max stirner thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre joseph proudhon theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france by the late various anarchist schools of thought had become well defined and wave of then unprecedented globalization occurred from to this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism mikhail bakunin who opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmen association class worker union later known as the first international that formed in to unite diverse revolutionary currents the international became significant political force with karl marx being leading figure and member of its general council bakunin faction the jura federation and proudhon followers the mutualists opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the hague congress anarchists were treated similarly in the second international being ultimately expelled in bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marx terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers in response to their expulsion from the first international anarchists formed the st imier international under the influence of peter kropotkin russian philosopher and scientist anarcho communism overlapped with collectivism anarcho communists who drew inspiration from the paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one needs at the turn of the century anarchism had spread all over the world it was notable feature of the international syndicalism movement in china small groups of students imported the humanistic pro science version of anarcho communism tokyo was hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east travelling to the japanese capital to study in latin america argentina was stronghold for anarcho syndicalism where it became the most prominent left wing ideology during this time minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence this strategy became known as propaganda of the deed the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from american immigration including the immigration act of also called the anarchist exclusion act illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine despite concerns anarchists participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilized several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine notably leading to the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhno struggle in the free territory with the anarchists being crushed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism the former sought to create coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble political party seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international in the spanish civil war of anarchists and syndicalists cnt and fai once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing pivotal role in the war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was bitter fight among communists and anarchists at series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republicans post war era rojava support efforts for workers to form cooperatives is exemplified in this sewing cooperative at the end of world war ii the anarchist movement was severely weakened however the witnessed revival of anarchism likely caused by perceived failure of marxism leninism and tensions built by the cold war during this time anarchism found presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti nuclear environmental and peace movements the counterculture of the and the new left it also saw transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anti capitalist reformism anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the established feminist tendencies of anarcha feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism move from eurocentric demographic this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti capitalist anti war and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization wto the group of eight and the world economic forum during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet significant event of this period was the confrontations at the seattle wto conference anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava de facto autonomous region in northern syria thought anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership in chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late th century and the post classical currents anarcha feminism green anarchism and post anarchism developed thereafter beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of minimal state but it argues that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have central role in anarchist philosophy anarchism emphasis on anti capitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism anarchism is usually placed on the far left of the political spectrum much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian anti statist libertarian and radical interpretations of left wing and socialist politics such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories as anarchism does not offer fixed body of doctrine from single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy mutual aid network organisation communal democracy justified authoritiy and classical pierre joseph proudhon the primary proponent of mutualism who influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist communist and syndicalist they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society mutualism is an th century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre joseph proudhon its aims include reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by bank of the people mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism in what is property proudhon first characterised his goal as third form of society the synthesis of communism and property collectivist anarchism is revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but it rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of collectivist stateless society anarcho communism is theory of anarchism that advocates communist society with common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and horizontal network of voluntary associations workers councils and worker cooperatives with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need anarcho communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but it was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late th century anarcho syndicalism is branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are direct action workers solidarity and workers self management individualist anarchism is set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau through many countries individualist anarchism attracted small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation post classical and contemporary lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors with zerzan being prominent voice within anarcho primitivism and jarach noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti globalisation movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation as the movement shaped st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled revival of interest anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches the anti capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism historical association with chaos and violence however its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently gender equality can be common principle although it ranks as higher priority to anarcha feminists than anarcho communists anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government monarchy representative democracy state socialism etc economic class systems capitalism bolshevism feudalism slavery etc autocratic religions fundamentalist islam roman catholicism etc patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism however anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy tactics anarchists tactics take various forms but in general they serve two major goals namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence reject violence and take gradual approach to anarchist aims although there is significant overlap between the two anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century anarchists during the early th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use broader array of approaches classical era tactics the relationship between anarchism and violence is controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist leon czolgosz assassinating william mckinley during the classical era anarchists had militant tendency not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful anarchists also took part in revolutions many anarchists especially the galleanists believed that these attempts would be the impetus for revolution against capitalism and the state many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late the early and the with some still occurring in the early their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial on one hand anarcho pacifists point out the unity of means and ends on the other hand other anarchist groups advocate direct action tactic which can include acts of sabotage or even acts of terrorism this attitude was quite prominent century ago when seeing the state as tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence argued that violence is merely reaction to state violence as necessary evil anarchists took an active role in strike actions although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist they saw it as part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced naturism and nudism those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media revolutionary tactics black bloc protesters parading anarcho communism imagery such as the motto no war but the class war in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies members of the invisible committee were arrested in on various charges terrorism included overall contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries such as canada greece and mexico militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking anti fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening evolutionary tactics anarchists commonly employ direct action this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of counter institutions such as communes and non hierarchical collectives decision making is often handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism contemporary era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism although not explicitly anarchist respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations in contrast with the big anarchism of the classical era the newly coined term small anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierre joseph proudhon to justify their opinions those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize the decision making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays significant tactical role anarchists have employed various methods in order to build rough consensus among members of their group without the need of leader or leading group one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting specific point minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics goals and values anarchists usually form small groups individuals to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by syndicate as in the past newspapers and journals are used but anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message however anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties hosting electronic libraries and other portals anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones taz spaces where art poetry and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal as seen by anarchists squatting is way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity key issues as anarchism is philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies schools of thought disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism collectivism marxism and trade unionism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others gender sexuality and free love émile armand french individualist anarchist who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy anarchism is obliged to address analyse and oppose the suppression of one autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose collection of anarcha feminist protests symbols and flags sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing however sexual violence was concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love in contemporary anarchism this current survives as tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men the notion of free love was much broader and included critique of the established order that limited women sexual freedom and pleasure those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together free love had roots both in europe and the united states however some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage pro choice utilising contemporary term and had similar agenda anarchist and non anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but they were nonetheless supportive of one another during the second half of the th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well by the latest decades of the th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalised groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting fusion of the two currents with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became subject of study for anarchists yielding post structuralist critique of sexual normality however some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation anarchism and education anarchist vs statist perspectives on educationruth kinna anarchist education state education concept education as self mastery education as service management community based state run methods practice based learning vocational training aims being critical member of society being productive member of society the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism anarchists consider proper education one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid anarchist writers such as william godwin political justice and max stirner the false principle of our education attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges in catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church ferrer approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested nonetheless his ideas formed the inspiration for series of modern schools around the world christian anarchist leo tolstoy who published the essay education and culture also established similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free in similar token neill founded what became the summerhill school in also declaring being free from coercion anarchist education is based largely on the idea that child right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of government and nationalism late th century and contemporary anarchist writers colin ward herbert read and paul goodman intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for system that focuses on children creativity rather than on their ability to attain career or participate in consumerism as part of consumer society contemporary anarchists such as ward have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day major tenets of anarchist schools among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of wider american canadian network of schools the self managed learning college in brighton england and the paideia school in spain anarchism and the state objection to the state and its institutions is sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion domination by means of coercion camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be john simmons and leslie green who leaned toward philosophical anarchism believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus although they saw this as highly unlikely beliefs on how to abolition the state also differ anarchism and art les chataigniers osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro an example of blending anarchism and art the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo romanticism movement in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read argued that the border between the artist and the non artist what separates art from daily act is construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living joyful life other anarchists advocated for or used art as means to achieve anarchist ends in his book breaking the spell history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris robé claims that anarchist inflected practices have increasingly structured movement based video activism throughout the th century many prominent anarchists peter kropotkin emma goldman gustav landauer and camillo berneri and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists it could depict critique of existing society and hierarchies serve as prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into means of direct action such as in protests as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have powerful effect the th century neo impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism in les chataigniers osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro the blending of aestetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community criticism the most common critique of anarchism is that humans can not self govern and state is necessary for human survival philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique noting that peace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in community in which there was no central government another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self governing colin ward responds that major anarchist thinkers advocated federalism philosophy lecturer andrew fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism fiala other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world at protests but in the world of ethics as well secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it the third argument is that anarchism is self contradictory while it advocates for no one to archiei if accepted by the many then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory in this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual hence no collective action can be taken lastly fiala mentions critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective all talk and thoughts and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro anarchist books such as john simmons moral principles and political obligations law professor william edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe the state duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate in the problem of political authority michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism claiming that political authority is moral illusion another criticism is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority as first articulated in an article for the north american review by frances ferguson joseph raz argues that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable nor does it involve complete surrender of independent judgment anarchist perception of human nature rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive overly simplistic and unrealistic respectively classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering academic john molyneux notes in his book anarchism marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has an utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values according to the marxist view that social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence marxists argue that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act in the anarchist vision the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining anarchism is also seen by marxists as unrealistic and overly idealistic karl marx described it as schoolboy asininity see also anarchism by country governance without government list of anarchist political ideologies list of

autism is developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at normal pace autism is associated with combination of genetic and environmental factors risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections such as rubella toxins including valproic acid alcohol cocaine pesticides lead and air pollution fetal growth restriction and autoimmune diseases controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypothesis which has been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm combines autism and less severe forms of the condition including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been cases of children who recovered some autistic adults are unable to live independently an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking cure and others believing autism should be accepted as difference to be accommodated instead of cured globally autism is estimated to affect million people in the the number of people affected was estimated at per people worldwide in the developed countries about of children are diagnosed with asd from in in the united states it occurs four to five times more often in males than females the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved characteristics autism is highly variable disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood and generally follows steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished by characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with typical neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to lower ability to define person own emotions children with high functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and meltdowns communication about third to half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in row autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs categorizes as follows stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behaviors time consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in specific order checking things or hand washing sameness resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted interests interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with single television program toy or game self injury behaviors such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated to of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur there is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria occurs more frequently in people with autism problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism these are linked to greater social impairment irritability behavior and sleep problems language impairments and mood changes parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults causes it has long been presumed that there is common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur deletion duplication and inversion are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for asd and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to mendelian single gene mutation or to single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily male condition but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males and theories have been put forward for genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd in both term and preterm infants maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues aggravating genetic problem or damaging the nervous system exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children mechanism autism symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple there is evidence that gut brain axis abnormalities may be involved review proposed that immune dysregulation inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain and dysfunction review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play role in neurological disorders such as autism neural connections and the immune system are pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi is semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used pediatrician commonly performs preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions pediatric is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile testing genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than three year old to continue to do so few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits signs of autism may be more challenging for clinicians to detect in females autistic females have been shown to engage in masking more frequently than autistic males masking may include making oneself perform normative facial expressions and eye contact notable percentage of autistic females may be misdiagnosed diagnosed after considerable delay or not diagnosed at all underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to loss of language or social skills as opposed to failure to make progress typically from to months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is specific subtype or that there is continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior spectrum autism has long been thought to cover wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds some researchers and autism rights activists have called for an end to the terms high functioning and low functioning due to lack of nuance and the potential for person needs or abilities to be overlooked screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child unusual behaviors by age months and about four fifths notice by age months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no response to name or eye to eye gaze by months no babbling by months no gesturing pointing waving etc by months no single words by months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by months loss of any language or social skills at any age the united states preventive services task force in found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at and months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged months suggests that it is best used in clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one culture norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features prevention while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases management three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment services should be carried out by behavior analysts special education teachers speech pathologists and licensed psychologists studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care communication and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability inattention or repetitive behavior patterns education educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on specific area of deficit the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention eibi treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children is currently low and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as probable efficacious mode of treatment early intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children it is also well established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group similarly teacher implemented intervention that utilizes more naturalistic form of aba combined with developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in gap between what report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails they may also be used for associated health problems such as adhd or anxiety more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fda approved for treating associated aggressive and self injurious behaviors however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically side effects for example may include weight gain tiredness drooling and aggression ssri antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autism core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance some alternative treatments may place the child at risk the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein free diets as consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin however suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and disorders in botched chelation therapy killed five year old child with autism chelation is not recommended for people with asd since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy mixture of homeopathy supplements and vaccine detoxing although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism as of there is no good evidence to recommend gluten and casein free diet as standard treatment review concluded that it may be therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism such as those with known food intolerances or allergies or with food intolerance markers the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten and casein free diet in children with asd in total all of them compared gluten and casein free diet versus normal diet with control group double blind randomized controlled trials double blind crossover trial single blind trial in two of the studies whose duration was and months significant improvement in asd symptoms efficacy rate was identified in the other two studies whose duration was months no significant effect was observed the authors concluded that longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet small sample size the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of placebo effect in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors results of systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness based interventions for improving mental health this includes decreasing stress anxiety ruminating thoughts anger and aggression there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions verbal communication and non verbal communication skills there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects prognosis there is no known cure the degree of symptoms can decrease occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often this outcome happens reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from to most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though few have developed communication skills in later years many children with autism lack social support future employment opportunities or self determination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above and having marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism many individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had job about half of people in their with autism are not employed epidemiology reports of autism cases per children grew dramatically in the us from to it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism most recent reviews tend to estimate prevalence of per for autism and close to per for asd as of survey in the united states reported rate of per children for asd globally autism affects an estimated million people while asperger syndrome affects further million in the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged years and over in the uk was rates of pdd nos has been estimated at per asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per cdc estimates about out of for an increase from out of every children for the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the and early this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism true prevalence has increased real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics males are at higher risk for asd than females the sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from to wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from to many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis history portrait of victor of aveyron feral child caught in who displayed possible symptoms of autism few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of year old boy who may have been severely autistic luther reportedly thought the boy was soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair marriage to gain blair inheritance the wild boy of aveyron feral child caught in showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word autós αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance soviet child psychiatrist grunya sukhareva described similar syndrome that was published in russian in and in german in clinical development and diagnoses leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in the word autism first took its modern sense in when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler terminology autistic psychopaths in lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as separate diagnosis until leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in report of children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanner first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism he was diagnosed by kanner after being first examined in and was labeled as case triplett was noted for his savant abilities particularly being able to name musical notes played on piano and to mentally multiply numbers his father oliver described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns music notes letters of the alphabet and president pictures by the age of he had the ability to recite the rd psalm and memorized questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism he was also interested in creating musical chords kanner reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late autism was established as separate syndrome terminology and distinction from schizophrenia as late as the mid there was little evidence of genetic role in autism while in it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research it took until for the dsm iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in the dsm iii provided checklist for diagnosing autism in may the dsm was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including pdd nos autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and or interaction and restricted and or repetitive behaviors the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with and has given them way to form online communities and work remotely societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being society and culture autism awareness ribbon an autistic culture has emerged accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements events include world autism awareness day autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include autistic self advocacy network aspies for freedom autism national committee and autism society of america at the same time some organizations including autism speaks have been condemned by disability rights organizations for exploitative practices and for failing to support autistic people social science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements while most autistic individuals do not have savant skills many have been successful in their fields autism rights movement the autism rights movement is social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity viewing the autism spectrum as result of natural variations in the human brain rather than disorder to be cured the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism and the recognition of the autistic community as minority group autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as natural expression of the human genome this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views the medical perspective that autism is caused by genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are high functioning or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of low functioning autistic people employment about half of autistics are unemployed and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed among autistics who find work most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children references external links
diffusely reflected sunlight relative to various surface conditions albedo meaning whiteness is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on scale from corresponding to black body that absorbs all incident radiation to corresponding to body that reflects all incident radiation surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance flux per unit area received by surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for single angle of incidence for given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between and μm this spectrum includes visible light μm which explains why surfaces with low albedo appear dark trees

leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria terrestrial albedo sample albedos surface typicalalbedo fresh asphalt open ocean worn asphalt conifer forest summer to deciduous forest to bare soil green grass desert sand new concrete ocean ice to fresh snow any albedo in visible light falls within range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of black body when seen from distance the ocean surface has low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for single direction by satellite not all directions mathematical model is used to translate sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo earth average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water so called ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost white sky black sky and blue sky albedo for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at particular solar zenith angle can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and the bi hemispherical reflectance sometimes referred to as white sky albedo with being the proportion of direct radiation from given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination the actual albedo also called blue sky albedo can then be given as this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface astronomical albedo the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time composes major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about typical comet nucleus has an albedo of such dark surface is thought to be indicative of primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is common source of confusion planet geometric bond mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and is the absolute magnitude examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where change in illumination induces change in the earth surface at that location through melting of reflective ice that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with local maximum in the tropics insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback loop results in reduced albedo effect climate and weather albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather albedo temperature feedback when an area albedo changes due to snowfall snow temperature feedback results layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow over antarctica snow albedo averages little more than if marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback just as fresh snow has higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snow covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow when sea ice melts either due to rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snow covered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of positive feedback both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying single value for albedo over broad regions small scale effects albedo works on smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon si and crystalline silicon si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications trees because forests generally have low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat as net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have value of about to variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water reflectivity of smooth water at refractive index water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from minimum of near to maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per spracklen et al the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is with range to black carbon is bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo human activities human activities deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the

greek letter alpha from which it derives the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of triangle crossed in the middle by horizontal bar the lowercase version can be written in two forms the double storey and single storey the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type in the english

the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from true alphabet in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as triangular head with two horns extended by bc the phoenician alphabet letter had linear form that served as the base

amodern roman modern italic amodern italic modern script amodern script when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems px english in modern english

alabama is state in the southeastern region of the united states it is bordered by tennessee to the north georgia to the east florida and the gulf of mexico to the south and mississippi to the west alabama is the th largest by area and the th most populous of the states with total of of inland waterways alabama has among the most of any state alabama is nicknamed the yellowhammer state after the state bird alabama is also known as the heart of dixie and the cotton state the state tree is the longleaf pine and the state flower is the camellia alabama capital is montgomery the largest city by population is birmingham which has long been the most industrialized city the largest city by land area is huntsville the oldest city is mobile founded by french colonists in as the capital of french louisiana greater birmingham is alabama largest urban economy its most populous urban area and its economic center from the american civil war until world war ii alabama like many states in the southern suffered economic hardship in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture similar to other former slave states alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against african americans from the end of the reconstruction era up until at least the despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white rural interests dominated the state legislature from to the during this time urban interests and african americans were markedly under represented following world war ii alabama grew as the state economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests the state economy in the st century is based on management automotive finance manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology etymology the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the word spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou sources disagree on the word meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the writings of alexander beaufort meek experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such translation history pre european settlement the moundville archaeological site in hale county it was occupied by native americans of the mississippian culture from to ce indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period bce ce and continued until european contact the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from to ce with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama this is the second largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era after cahokia in present day illinois which was the center of the culture analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex secc contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture but developed independently the ceremonial complex represents major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood among the historical tribes of native american people living in present day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language people and the muskogean speaking alabama alibamu chickasaw choctaw creek and koasati while part of the same large language family the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages european settlement with exploration in the th century the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in more than years later the french founded the region first european settlement at old mobile in the city was moved to the current site of mobile in this area was claimed by the french from to as part of la louisiane after the french lost to the british in the seven years war it became part of british west florida from to after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war the territory was divided between the united states and spain the latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to forces on april thomas bassett loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile he settled in the tombigbee district during the early the district boundaries were roughly limited to the area within few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county northernmost mobile county and most of washington county what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in part of the independent republic of west florida in and was finally added to the mississippi territory in most of what is now the northern two thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period it was claimed by the province of georgia from onwards following the revolutionary war it remained part of georgia although heavily disputed with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower one third of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in the yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the yazoo land scandal spain kept claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams onís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in early th century upright before mississippi admission to statehood on december the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory the united states congress created the alabama territory on march st stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to alabama was admitted as the nd state on december with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention from july to august delegates met to prepare the new state constitution huntsville served as temporary capital from to when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county cahaba now ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation part of the frontier in the and its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men thornhill in greene county it is former black belt plantation southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded the economy of the central black belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor the area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers alabama had an estimated population of under people in but it increased to more than people by most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in from to tuscaloosa served as alabama capital on january the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery the first legislative session in the new capital met in december new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia the first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine civil war and reconstruction by the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved african americans and were free people of color on january alabama declared its secession from the union after remaining an independent republic for few days it joined the confederate states of america the confederacy capital was initially at montgomery alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort union army troops occupying courthouse square in huntsville following its capture and occupation by federal forces in company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrest battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army alabama slaves were freed by the th amendment in alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may until its official restoration to the union in from to with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin turner and james rapier following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified new state constitution in which created the state first public school system and expanded women rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in after most african americans and many poor whites in the constitution the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the th century to impose segregation in everyday life th century the developing skyline of birmingham in the new constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring poll tax and literacy test the constitution required racial segregation of public schools by only african americans were registered in alabama although at least were literate this compared to more than african americans eligible to vote in the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their as well due mostly to the imposition of cumulative poll tax by whites constituted slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs african americans nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in it was one of the rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city by birmingham was the th largest city in the united states heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following lawsuit and court order industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently in the legislature study noted that because of rural domination minority of about of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature in the united states supreme court cases of baker carr and reynolds sims the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of

school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local

building in montgomery completed in the foundational document for alabama government is the alabama constitution which was ratified in at almost amendments and words it is by some accounts the world longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution there has been significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama constitution critics argue that alabama constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism heflin torbert judicial building in montgomery it houses the supreme court of alabama alabama court of civil appeals and alabama court of criminal appeals alabama government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with members and the alabama senate with members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override gubernatorial veto by simple majority most state legislatures require two thirds majority to override veto until the state elected state senators on geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as result urbanized areas were grossly it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds sims the supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments republican kay ivey is the current governor of alabama the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the lieutenant governor of alabama the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor is republican kay ivey the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the state highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican tom parker all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas state which has population five times larger however executions per capita are significantly higher in texas some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned convictions in death penalty cases it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use death sentence in cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries this judicial authority was removed in april taxes taxes are collected by the alabama department of revenue alabama levies or percent personal income tax depending on the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax even if taking the standard deduction those who itemize can also deduct fica the social security and medicare tax the state general sales tax rate is sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is and there is an additional restaurant tax of which means diner in mobile would pay an tax on meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low income families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply lower tax rate alabama income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the alabama is the only state that levies income tax on family of four with income as low as which is barely one quarter the federal poverty line alabama threshold is the lowest among the states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the the current state constitution requires voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabama tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as million county and local governments alabama has counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabama constitution has been amended more than times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning the state government holds monopoly on the sale of alcohol the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state total of of the counties are dry counties which ban the sale of alcohol and there are many dry municipalities in counties

lauderdale florence florence politics during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the black vote through violence fraud and intimidation after coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents process completed in provisions of the constitution provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites by more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised to the total effects were greater on the black community as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from through the the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until series of federal court cases required redistricting in to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the and during the civil rights movement when whites and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the state only four term governor was controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of and voting rights act of did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable more diverse representation among county boards in the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed resolution

southern state for nearly hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late th century however white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the then incumbent chief justice ernest hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to republican perry hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the three gop lieutenant governors are steve windom kay ivey and will ainsworth present local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions alabama county sheriffs are elected in partisan at large races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts the current split is democrats republicans and one independent fayette however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban suburban and heavily populated counties the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and ten african american sheriffs federal elections the state two senators are republican richard shelby and democrat doug jones shelby was originally elected to the senate as democrat in and re elected in but switched parties immediately following the november general election in the house of representatives the state is represented by seven members six of

pottery painting dating to bc of achilles during the trojan war in greek mythology achilles or achilleus was hero of the trojan war the greatest of all the greek warriors and is the central character of homer iliad he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus king of phthia achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him in the heel with an arrow later legends beginning with statius unfinished epic achilleid written in the st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel because when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends etymology linear tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms ki re and ki re we the latter being the dative of the former the name grew more popular even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία achilleía attested in attica in the fourth century bc ig ii² and in the form achillia on stele in halicarnassus as the name of female gladiator fighting an amazon achilles name can be analyzed as combination of distress pain sorrow grief and people soldiers nation resulting in proto form akhí lāu os he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress the grief or distress of the people is theme raised numerous times in the iliad and frequently by achilles himself achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of glory usually in war furthermore laós has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean corps of soldiers muster with this derivation the name obtains double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership the education of achilles by eugène delacroix pastel on paper getty center los angeles another etymology relates the name to proto indo european compound h₂eḱ pṓds sharp foot which first gave an illyrian āk pediós evolving through time into ākhpdeós and then akhiddeús the shift from dd to ll is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via pre greek source the first root part h₂eḱ sharp pointed also gave greek ἀκή akḗ point silence healing ἀκμή akmḗ point edge zenith and ὀξύς oxús sharp pointed keen quick clever whereas ἄχος stems from the root h₂egʰ to be upset afraid the whole expression would be comparable to the latin acupedius swift of foot compare also the latin word family of aciēs sharp edge or point battle line battle engagement acus needle pin bodkin and acuō to make pointed sharpen whet to exercise to arouse whence acute some topical epitheta of achilles in the iliad point to this swift footedness namely ποδάρκης δῖος ἀχιλλεὺς podárkēs dĩos achilleús swift footed divine achilles or even more frequently πόδας ὠκὺς ἀχιλλεύς pódas ōkús achilleús quick footed achilles some researchers deem the name loan word possibly from pre greek language achilles descent from the nereid thetis and similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity see below worship robert beekes has suggested pre greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of λλ and in epic language which may account for palatalized phoneme ly in the original language birth and early years achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and of peleus the king of the myrmidons zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of prophecy originally uttered by themis goddess of divine law that thetis would bear son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus thetis dipping the infant achilles into the river styx by peter paul rubens museum boijmans van beuningen rotterdam there is tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to hera marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods thetis although daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal chiron teaching achilles how to play the lyre roman fresco from herculaneum st century ad james barry yale center for british art according to the achilleid written by statius in the st century ad and to non surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel see achilles heel achilles tendon it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in rage none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander he cast two spears at once one grazed achilles elbow drawing spurt of blood also in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which one can find description of the hero death the cypria the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha the aithiopis and iliou persis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his torso peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur on mount pelion to be reared thetis foretold that her son fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live long but uneventful life in obscurity achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war according to homer achilles grew up in phthia together with his companion patroclus according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in secret place the children she had by peleus but when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot other names among the appellations under which achilles is generally known are the following pyrisous saved from the fire his first name which seems to favour the tradition in which his mortal parts were burned by his mother thetis aeacides from his grandfather aeacus aemonius from aemonia country which afterwards acquired the name of thessaly aspetos inimitable or vast his name at epirus larissaeus from larissa also called cremaste town of thessaly which still bears the same name ligyron his original name nereius from his mother thetis one of the nereids pelides from his father peleus phthius from his birthplace phthia podarkes swift footed due to the wings of arke being attached to his feet hidden on skyros some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles is disguised as girl and lives among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he rapes achilles there fathers two sons neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father possible alias and oneiros according to this story odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of peddler selling women clothes and jewellery and places shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly takes up the spear odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranges for trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women flee in panic achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away in the trojan war achilles and agamemnon from mosaic from pompeii st century ad according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with ships each carrying myrmidons he appointed five leaders each leader commanding myrmidons menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed troilus achilles slaying troilus red figure kylix signed by euphronios according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like pedasus and lyrnessus where the greeks capture the queen briseis and killed tenes son of apollo as well as priam son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucer troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeare troilus and cressida is medieval invention in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was young trojan prince the youngest of king priam and hecuba five legitimate sons or according other sources another son of apollo despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo thymbraios later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of dead child mourned by his parents had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in plautus bacchides in the iliad achilles cedes briseis to agamemnon from the house of the tragic poet in pompeii fresco st century ad naples national archaeological museum homer iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war achilles wrath μῆνις ἀχιλλέως mênis achilléōs is the central theme of the poem the first two lines of the iliad read μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ πηληιάδεω ἀχιλῆος οὐλομένην μυρί ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε ἔθηκε sing goddess of the rage of peleus son achilles the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the achaeans the homeric epic only covers few weeks of the decade long war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces agamemnon has taken woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refuses and apollo sends plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loves briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces at the same time burning with rage over agamemnon theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do the rage of achilles fresco by giovanni battista tiepolo villa valmarana ai nani vicenza the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead proper assault on the city of troy after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companion death his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself finally achilles finds his prey achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot after having dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral achilles hosts series of funeral games in his honour at the onset of his duel with hector achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn orion dog sirius sign of evil during the cremation of patroclus he is compared to hesperus the evening western star venus while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus the morning eastern star also venus has set descended with the assistance of the god hermes argeiphontes hector father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hector body so that he can be buried achilles relents and promises truce for the duration of the funeral lasting days with burial on the th in the tradition of niobe offspring the poem ends with description of hector funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come later epic accounts fighting penthesilea and memnon achilles and memnon fighting between thetis and eos attic black figure amphora bc from vulci the aethiopis th century bc and work named posthomerica composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ad relate further events from the trojan war when penthesilea queen of the amazons and daughter of ares arrives in troy priam hopes that she will defeat achilles after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her following the death of patroclus nestor son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion when memnon son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of goddess many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliad description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the th century bc the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors achilles and patroclus achilles tending patroclus wounded by an arrow attic red figure kylix bc altes museum berlin the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it appears to be the model of deep and loyal friendship homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures in th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia in plato symposium the participants in dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover however ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply homosexual relationship death the death of achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is complex one with many different versions in the oldest one the iliad and as predicted by hector with his dying breath the hero death was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with poisoned arrow all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour owing to the common conception that paris was coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield his bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube dying achilles achilleas thniskon in the gardens of the achilleion another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena achilles asks priam for polyxena hand in marriage priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world greatest warrior but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with divine arrow killing him in the odyssey agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades he claims they built massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles in book of homer odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead but achilles then asks odysseus of his son exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica rd century bc fate of achilles armour attic black figure lekythos from sicily bc staatliche munich achilles armour was the object of feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both men presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned him the ire of athena who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades after while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades odyssey ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia port on the pamphylian gulf the city was visited in bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the nd century ad achilles ajax and game of petteia numerous paintings on pottery have suggested tale not mentioned in the literary traditions at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing board game petteia they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena worship and heroic cult tripod in front on the polyxena sarcophagus circa bc roman statue of man with the dead body of boy identified as achilles and troilus nd century ad naples national archaeological museum the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla achilles cult was also to be found at other places on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had sanctuary in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero the cult of achilles is illustrated in the bc polyxena sarcophagus where the sacrifice of polixena near the tumulus of achilles is depicted strabo also suggested that such cult of achilles existed in troad the spread and intensity of the hero veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus today black sea appears to have been remarkable an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island ukrainian зміїний zmiinyi near kiliya ukraine early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from olbia the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards the cult was still thriving in the third century ad when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ποντάρχης roughly lord of the sea or of the pontus euxinus who was invoked as protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon pliny the elder ad in his natural history mentions port of the achæi and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man portus achaeorum insula achillis tumulo eius viri clara situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper bug estuary furthermore at roman miles from this island he places peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of sword obliquely called dromos achilleos ἀχιλλέως δρόμος achilléōs drómos the race course of achilles and considered the place of the hero exercise or of games instituted by him this last feature of pliny account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly roman miles km away from the dnieper bug estuary as pliny states to the race course he gives length of miles km whereas the spit measures km today in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron from greek νῆσος μακαρῶν island of the blest the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with today snake island pliny contemporary pomponius mela ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion ruins of square temple measuring meters to side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in on snake island second exploration in showed that the construction of lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple fifth century bc black glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by citizen of olbia while in further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island cult again suggesting its quality as place of supra regional hero veneration the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to mythical λεύκη νῆσος leúkē nêsos white island already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned cult of achilles on bright island φαεννά νᾶσος phaenná nâsos of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles μακαρῶν νῆσοι makárôn nêsoi or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death the periplus of the euxine sea ad gives the following details the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who lived probably during the first century ad wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour similarly others relate the island name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue leuce had also reputation as place of healing pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent lord of croton to be cured of chest wound ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of town achílleion ἀχίλλειον built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the hero presumed burial mound in the troad later attestations point to an achílleion in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an achílleios ἀχίλλειος in laconia nicolae densuşianu recognized connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia presumably from an older achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea law the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy in ad the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus reception during antiquity in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce workable modern play the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only few lines survive today in plato symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles play with achilles as the main character only few fragments survive towards the end of the th century bc more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis in greek philosophy the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to tortoise with head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible as student of the monist parmenides and member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions achilles in roman and medieval literature the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took highly negative view of achilles virgil refers to achilles as savage and merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de sainte maure roman de troie and guido delle colonne historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the th century achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellene but as scythian

congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers and it cost lincoln political

reputation gave rise to the nickname honest abe lincoln argued in an criminal trial defending william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincoln use of fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced farmers almanac showing the moon was at low angle drastically reducing visibility armstrong was acquitted leading up to his presidential campaign lincoln elevated his profile in an murder case with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was third cousin harrison was also the grandson of lincoln political opponent rev peter cartwright harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who as he lay dying of his wounds confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison lincoln angrily protested the judge initial decision to exclude cartwright testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay lincoln argued that the testimony involved dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected the judge democrat reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence resulting in harrison acquittal republican politics emergence as republican leader his debates with stephen douglas over slavery the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave holding south and the free north with the failure of the compromise of legislative package designed to address the issue in his eulogy for clay lincoln highlighted the latter support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious illinois senator stephen douglas proposed popular sovereignty as compromise the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery the legislation alarmed many northerners who sought to prevent the resulting spread of slavery but douglas kansas nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech in october lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency he said the kansas act had declared indifference but as must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery cannot but hate it hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world lincoln attacks on the kansas nebraska act marked his return to political life nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue reflecting on the demise of his party lincoln wrote in think am whig but others say there are no whigs and that am an abolitionist do no more than oppose the extension of slavery the new republican party was formed as northern party dedicated to antislavery drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members lincoln resisted early republican entreaties fearing that the new party would become platform for extreme abolitionists lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs though he lamented his party growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement in lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat the year elections showed the strong opposition to the kansas nebraska act and in the aftermath lincoln sought election to the united states senate at that time senators were elected by the state legislature after leading in the first six rounds of voting he was unable to obtain majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig lincoln decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson campaign violent political confrontations in kansas continued and opposition to the kansas nebraska act remained strong throughout the north as the elections approached lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party the convention platform endorsed congress right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as free state lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union at the june republican national convention though lincoln received support to run as vice president john frémont and william dayton comprised the ticket which lincoln supported throughout illinois the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore buchanan prevailed while

dred scott was slave whose master took him from slave state to free territory under the missouri compromise after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned federal court for his freedom his petition was denied in dred scott sandford supreme court chief justice roger taney in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north lincoln denounced it as the product of conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincoln douglas debates and cooper union speech in douglas was up for re election in the senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him many in the party felt that former whig should be nominated in and lincoln campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him favor some eastern republicans supported

held convention to agree upon senate candidate and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition abraham lincoln by mathew brady taken the day of the cooper union speech accepting the nomination lincoln delivered his house divided speech with the biblical reference mark house divided against itself cannot stand believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free do not expect the union to be dissolved do not expect the house to fall but do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created stark image of the danger of disunion the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas when informed of lincoln nomination douglas stated lincoln is the strong man of the party and if beat him my victory will be hardly won the senate campaign featured seven debates between the two these were the most famous political debates in american history they had an atmosphere akin to prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that douglas slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers premise that all men are created equal douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists lincoln argument assumed moral tone as he claimed douglas represented conspiracy to promote slavery douglas argument was more legal claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the supreme court in the dred scott decision though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas lincoln articulation of the issues gave him national political presence in may lincoln purchased the illinois staats anzeiger german language newspaper that was consistently supportive most of the state german americans voted democratic but the german language paper mobilized republican support in the aftermath of the election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as potential republican presidential candidate rivaled by william seward salmon chase edward bates and simon cameron while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office in january lincoln told group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy on february powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give speech at cooper union in which he argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to new york audience historian david herbert donald described the speech as superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival seward own state at an event

beating candidates such as seward and chase former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincoln success depended on his campaign team his reputation as moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff pennsylvania put him over the top led by the state iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support lincoln managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincoln dictate to make no contracts that bind me as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party throughout the lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention they opposed douglas position on popular sovereignty and selected incumbent vice president john breckinridge as their candidate group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south prior to the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating nationwide youth organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties lincoln ideas of abolishing slavery grew drawing more supporters people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln as douglas and the other candidates campaigned lincoln gave no speeches relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials republican speakers focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor which allowed common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts the republican party production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition chicago tribune writer produced pamphlet that detailed lincoln life and sold copies on november lincoln was elected the th president he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in of the southern slave states and he won only two of counties in all the southern states lincoln

to lincoln election secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march on december south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed six of these states declared themselves to be sovereign nation the confederate states of america and adopted constitution the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas initially rejected the secessionist appeal president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the party platform of free soil in the territories lincoln said will suffer death before consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have constitutional right lincoln tacitly supported the corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed few weeks before the war lincoln sent letter to every governor informing them congress had passed joint resolution to amend the constitution capitol building the dome above the rotunda was still under construction en route to his inauguration lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north the president elect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore on february he arrived in disguise in washington which was placed under substantial military guard lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south stating one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended this is the only substantial dispute the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature the failure of the peace conference of signaled that legislative compromise was impossible by march no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated in his second inaugural address lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war

lincoln henry hunt fitz john porter andrew humphreys capt george armstrong custer alt lincoln among group of soldiers in military camp major robert anderson commander of the union fort sumter in charleston south carolina sent request for provisions to washington and lincoln order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war on april confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on volcano and that the south was preparing for war donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that on april lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view remained intact despite the seceding states this call forced states to choose sides virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital despite its exposure to union lines north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed over the following two months secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky remained neutral the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason dixon line to defend the nation as states sent union regiments south on april

local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus where needed for the security of troops trying to reach washington john merryman one maryland official hindering the troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice roger taney to issue writ of habeas corpus in june taney ruling only for the lower circuit court in ex parte merryman issued the writ which he felt could only be suspended by congress lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas union military strategy lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander in chief by exercising unprecedented authority he expanded his war powers imposed blockade on confederate ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress suspended habeas corpus and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict running the machine an political cartoon satirizing lincoln administration featuring william fessenden edwin stanton william seward gideon welles lincoln and others it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery on august lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates the law had little practical effect but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery in august general john frémont the republican presidential nominee without consulting washington issued martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity as result union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over internationally lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner in the trent affair which threatened war with great britain the navy

diplomats biographer james randall dissected lincoln successful techniques lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department he tracked all phases of the effort consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success their state and their party in january after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton stanton centralized the war department activities auditing and canceling contracts saving the federal government stanton was staunch unionist pro business conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman lincoln war strategy embraced two priorities ensuring that washington was well defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for prompt decisive victory twice week lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon occasionally mary prevailed on him to take carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard for his edification lincoln relied upon book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science halleck was disciple of the european strategist antoine henri jomini lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy army rather than simply capturing territory general mcclellan after the union rout at bull run and winfield scott retirement lincoln appointed major general george mcclellan general in chief mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign mcclellan slow progress frustrated lincoln as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington mcclellan in turn blamed the failure of the campaign on lincoln reservation of troops for the capitol lincoln and mcclellan in lincoln removed mcclellan for the general continued inaction he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia pope satisfied lincoln desire to advance on richmond from the north thus protecting washington from counterattack but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington two days after mcclellan return to command general robert lee forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam that battle union victory was among the bloodiest in american history it facilitated lincoln emancipation proclamation in january mcclellan then resisted the president demand that he pursue lee withdrawing army while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincoln part burnside against presidential advice launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december desertions during came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker in the midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation high taxes rumors of corruption suspension of habeas corpus military draft law and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest where

young man lincoln was religious skeptic he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others he never made clear profession of christian beliefs through his entire public career lincoln had proneness for quoting scripture his three most famous speeches the house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inaugural each contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture in the lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity belief that the human mind was controlled by higher power with the death of his son edward in he more frequently expressed dependence on god he never joined church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in in the lincoln asserted his belief in providence in general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence the death of son willie in february may have caused him to look toward religion for solace after willie death he questioned the divine necessity of the war severity he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds lincoln did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by was expressing those beliefs in major speeches by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april to newspaper editor in kentucky claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me now at the end of three years struggle the nation condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected god alone can claim it whither it is tending seems plain if god now wills the removal of great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least lincoln explains therein the cause purpose and result of the war was god will later in life lincoln frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs and might have been device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land health lincoln in february two months before his death lincoln is believed to have had depression smallpox and malaria he took blue mass pills which contained mercury to treat constipation it is unknown to what extent he may have suffered from mercury poisoning several claims have been made that lincoln health was declining before the assassination these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting it is also suspected that he might have had rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type legacy republican values lincoln redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins harry jaffa vernon burton eric foner and herman belz lincoln called the declaration of independence which emphasized freedom and equality for all the sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the he did this at time when the constitution which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse diggins notes lincoln presented americans theory of history that offers profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the cooper union speech instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism his position on war though was founded on legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract further it was national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs as whig activist lincoln was spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats william harris found that lincoln reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism james randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders reunification of the states in lincoln first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints he said majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of free people the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people view the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular the civil war was significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the th century historical reputation in surveys of scholars ranking presidents conducted since the top three presidents are lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies between and lincoln john kennedy and ronald reagan have been the top ranked presidents in eight surveys according to gallup study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after george washington lincoln memorial in washington lincoln assassination left him national martyr he was viewed by abolitionists as champion of human liberty republicans linked lincoln name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as man of outstanding ability historians have said he was classical liberal in the th century sense allen guelzo states that lincoln was classical liberal democrat an enemy of artificial hierarchy friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office schwartz argues that lincoln american reputation grew slowly from the late th century until the progressive era when he emerged as one of america most venerated heroes even among white southerners the high point came in with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state an american coin portraying lincoln sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the and the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as means for seeing the world disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful franklin roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincoln symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness he suggested that postmodernism and have diluted greatness as concept in the cold war years lincoln image shifted to symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes by the late some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr rejected lincoln role as the great emancipator bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln white supremacist in he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation by the lincoln had become hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers lincoln became favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world historian barry schwartz wrote in that lincoln image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late th century on the other hand donald opined in his biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason in the st century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in flattering light memory and memorials lincoln portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the bill his likeness also appears on many postage stamps while he is usually portrayed bearded he grew beard in at the suggestion of year old grace bedell he was the first of presidents to do so he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the

aristotle aristotélēs bc was greek philosopher and polymath during the classical period in ancient greece taught by plato he was the founder of the lyceum the peripatetic school of philosophy and the aristotelian tradition his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theatre music rhetoric psychology linguistics economics politics and government aristotle provided complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon as well as problems and methods of inquiry as result his philosophy has exerted unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be subject of contemporary philosophical discussion little is known about his life aristotle was born in the city of stagira in northern greece his father nicomachus died when aristotle was child and he was brought up by guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined plato academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven bc shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in bc he established library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication aristotle views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed some of aristotle zoological observations found in his biology such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were disbelieved until the th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan aristotle influence on logic also continued well into the th century he influenced judeo islamic philosophies during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics such as in the thinking of alasdair macintyre and philippa foot life mieza macedonia greece in general the details of aristotle life are not well established the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on few salient points aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km miles east of modern day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon both of aristotle parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian although little information about aristotle childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato academy he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries to experience is to learn παθείν μαθεĩν aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy direction after control passed to plato nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermias adoptive daughter or niece she bore him daughter whom they also named pythias in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander portrait bust of aristotle an imperial roman st or nd century ad copy of lost bronze sculpture made by lysippos aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during aristotle time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotle own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be leader to the greeks and despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him son whom he named after his father nicomachus if we believed the suda an uncritical compilation from the middle ages he may also had an erômenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander relationship with persia and persians widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing role in alexander death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexander death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy reference to athens trial and execution of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife speculative philosophy logic with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion organon one of aristotle types of syllogism in words in terms in equations all men are mortal all greeks are men all greeks are mortal ps ms px what we today call aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers the books are categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations plato left and aristotle in raphael fresco the school of athens aristotle holds his nicomachean ethics and gestures to the earth representing his view in immanent realism whilst plato gestures to the heavens indicating his theory of forms and holds his timaeus the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics metaphysics the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotle works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative theoretikē philosophy which is theological and studies the divine he wrote in his metaphysics substance aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti ên einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that particular substance is combination of both matter and form philosophical theory called hylomorphism in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form immanent realism plato forms exist as universals like the ideal form of an apple for aristotle both matter and form belong to the individual thing hylomorphism like his teacher plato aristotle philosophy aims at the universal aristotle ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is separately existing form which actual things imitate for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in particular substance plato argued that all things have universal form which could be either property or relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyse form of an apple in this distinction there is particular apple and universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still proper universal form aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals where plato spoke of the world of forms place where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms potentiality and actuality with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the potential made actual by learning the coming to be is change where nothing persists of which the resultant is property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when plant does one of the activities that plants do in summary the matter used to make house has potentiality to be house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same epistemology aristotle immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from priori principles natural philosophy aristotle natural philosophy spans wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences in aristotle terminology natural philosophy is branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences aristotle work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics physics the four classical elements fire air water earth of empedocles and aristotle illustrated with burning log the log releases all four elements as it is destroyed five elements in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions aristotle scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets aristotle elements element motion modern stateof matter earth down solid water down liquid air up gas fire up plasma aether divinesubstance circular in heavens motion aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of thrown stone in the physics and natural motion such as of falling object in on the heavens in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rest since aristotle does not address friction with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects on the ground say require more force to make them move and objects pushed with greater force move faster this would imply the equation incorrect in modern physics natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in circle around the heavens while the empedoclean elements move vertically up like fire as is observed or down like earth towards their natural resting places physics he states that objects fall at speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in this is correct approximation for objects in earth gravitational field moving in air or water in the physics aristotle effectively states quantitative law that the speed of falling body is proportional say with constant to its weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid in which it is falling aristotle implies that in vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that vacuum is not possible opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotle concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this archimedes corrected aristotle theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition aristotle writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period john philoponus in the middle ages and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotle claim that heavier object falls faster than lighter object is incorrect contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotle physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earth gravitational field immersed in fluid such as air in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones whether friction is ignored or not and they do fall more slowly in denser medium newton forced motion corresponds to aristotle violent motion with its external agent but aristotle assumption that the agent effect stops immediately it stops acting the ball leaves the thrower hand has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus four causes aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that thing takes its form from four causes in the case of table the wood used material cause its design formal cause the tools and techniques used efficient cause and its decorative or practical purpose final cause aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of table is wood it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form the arrangement of that matter it tells us what thing is that thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole macrostructure is the cause of its parts relationship known as the whole part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs in the case of two dominoes when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over in the case of animals this agency is combination of how it develops from the egg and how its body functions the final cause telos is its purpose the reason why thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition in the case of living things it implies adaptation to particular way of life optics aristotle describes experiments in optics using camera obscura in problems book the apparatus consisted of dark chamber with small aperture that let light in with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the sun image always remained circular he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to people moral choices astronomy in astronomy aristotle refuted democritus claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun rays pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them aristotle noted that the ground level of the aeolian islands changed before volcanic eruption geology aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person lifetime the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to volcanic eruption biology hectocotyl arm of the octopus bottom left empirical research aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms large part of his writings he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived aristotle reports on the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the th century he gives accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark he notes that an animal structure is well matched to function so among birds the heron which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish has long neck and long legs and sharp spear like beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution aristotle writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur he saw these as rare accidents for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes he was thus critical of empedocles materialist theory of survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct scientific style aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals including that brood size decreases with body mass whereas gestation period increases he was correct in these predictions at least for mammals data are shown for mouse and elephant aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection in generation of animals he finds fertilized hen egg of suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo heart beating inside instead he practiced different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in new field such as genomics it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs narrative explanation of what is observed in this sense aristotle biology is scientific from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite number of rules relating the life history features of the live bearing tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals that he studied among these correct predictions are the following brood size decreases with adult body mass so that an elephant has fewer young usually just one per brood than mouse lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have longer period of gestation and are heavier as final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so long lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short lived kinds like mice classification of living things aristotle recorded that the embryo of dogfish was attached by cord to kind of placenta the yolk sac like higher animal this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest aristotle distinguished about species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in graded scale of perfection scala naturae with man at the top his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry mineral like eggs animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals see also he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood those with blood were divided into the live bearing mammals and the egg laying birds reptiles fish those without blood were insects crustacea non shelled cephalopods and shelled and the hard shelled molluscs bivalves and gastropods he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had placenta like the tetrapods to modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design aristotle scala naturae highest to lowest group examples given by aristotle blood legs souls rational sensitive vegetative qualities man man with blood legs live bearing tetrapods cat hare with blood legs cetaceans dolphin whale with blood none birds bee eater nightjar with blood legs except eggs egg laying tetrapods chameleon crocodile with blood legs except scales eggs snakes water snake ottoman viper with blood none except scales eggs egg laying fishes sea bass parrotfish with blood none including eggs among the egg laying fishes placental selachians shark skate with blood none but placenta like tetrapods crustaceans shrimp crab without many legs except shell cephalopods squid octopus without tentacles hard shelled animals cockle trumpet snail without none mineral shell larva bearing insects ant cicada without legs spontaneously generating sponges worms without none or from earth plants fig without none minerals iron without none none psychology soul structure for souls of plants animals and humans making humans unique in having all three types of soul aristotle psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psychēs posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have rational soul the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous intellect and logos reason for aristotle the soul is the form of living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon memory according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words memory is mental picture phantasm that can be recovered aristotle believed an impression is left on semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make memory memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian common sense and thinking aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at particular time and processing specific contents memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences to search for these impressions people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed recollection is thus the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in memory impression only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed senses perception memory dreams action in aristotle psychology impressions are stored in the sensorium the heart linked by his laws of association similarity contrast and contiguity aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body while person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary dreams do not involve actually sensing stimulus in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner aristotle explains that when person stares at moving stimulus such as the waves in body of water and then look away the next thing they look at appears to have wavelike motion when person perceives stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience during sleep person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares sleeping person to person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward stimulus for example person who has strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings since person sleeping is in suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature in de anima iii aristotle ascribes the ability to create to store and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination phantasia one component of aristotle theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by divine being aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences aristotle claimed that dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if person had an image appear for moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while person is asleep does not qualify as part of dream for example if while person is sleeping door shuts and in their dream they hear door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences practical philosophy aristotle practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric virtues and their accompanying vices too little virtuous mean too much humbleness high mindedness vainglory lack of purpose right ambition over ambition spiritlessness good temper irascibility rudeness civility obsequiousness cowardice courage rashness insensibility self control intemperance sarcasm sincerity boastfulness boorishness wit buffoonery shamelessness modesty shyness callousness just resentment spitefulness pettiness generosity vulgarity meanness liberality wastefulness just war theory aristotelian just war theory is not well regarded in the present day especially his view that warfare was justified to enslave natural slaves in aristotelian philosophy the abolition of what he considers natural slavery would undermine civic freedom the pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over those who deserve to be slaves according to the cambridge companion to aristotle politics the targets of this aggressive warfare were non greeks noting aristotle view that our poets say it is proper for greeks to rule non greeks aristotle generally has favourable opinion of war extolling it as chance for virtue and writing that the leisure that accompanies peace tends to make people arrogant war to avoid becoming enslaved to others is justified as self defense he writes that war compels people to be just and temperate however in order to be just war must be chosen for the sake of peace with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above ethics aristotle considered ethics to be practical rather than theoretical study one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of thing an eye is only good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity the virtuous mean between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve virtuous and potentially happy character requires first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words philosopher politics in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he famously stated that man is by nature political animal and argued that humanity defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like machine and as collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotle conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner aristotle classifications of political constitutions the common modern understanding of political community as modern state is quite different from aristotle understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as political community or partnership koinōnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences in protrepticus the character aristotle states economics aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought especially to thought in the middle ages in politics aristotle addresses the city property and trade his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbins view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver aristotle discussions on retail and interest was major influence on economic thought in the middle ages he had low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make profit it thus uses goods as means to an end rather than as an end unto itself he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural similarly aristotle considered making profit through interest unnatural as it makes gain out of the money itself and not from its use aristotle gave summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of single universal standard of measurement money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange making it sort of security that is if we do not want thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it rhetoric and poetics the blind oedipus commending his children to the gods by bénigne gagneraux in his poetics aristotle uses the tragedy oedipus tyrannus by sophocles as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured with generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous but loses everything through some hamartia fault aristotle rhetoric proposes that speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos an appeal to the speaker character pathos an appeal to the audience emotion and logos an appeal to logical reasoning he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres epideictic ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame forensic judicial speeches over guilt or innocence and deliberative speeches calling on an audience to make decision on an issue aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme proof by syllogism and paradeigma proof by example aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis imitation each varying in imitation by medium object and manner he applies the term mimesis both as property of work of art and also as the product of the artist intention and contends that the audience realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself aristotle states that mimesis is natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama while it is believed that aristotle poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in tragedy are merely means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotle analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to women happiness as he did to men and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men influence more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method taneli kukkonen writing in the classical tradition observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long as result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotle intellectual afterlife would be little less than history of european thought on his successor theophrastus frontispiece to version of theophrastus historia plantarum originally written around bc aristotle pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants pioneering work in botany some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned on later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter bringing with him on his expedition host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall surpass other men if those doctrines wherein have been trained are to be all men common property on hellenistic science after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted fundamental critique of aristotle views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought philoponus questioned aristotle teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations after hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena on the medieval islamic world islamic portrayal of aristotle aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus greatly admired aristotle philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy on medieval europe aristotle ridden by phyllis by hans baldung with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from ad to except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbeke translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotle writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the king seductive mistress phyllis but was himself captivated by her and allowed her to ride him phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect and he witnessed phyllis proving that woman charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher male intellect artists such as hans baldung produced series of illustrations of the popular theme the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy dante inferno canto iv translation hell vidi maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vid ïo socrate platone che nnanzi li altri più presso li stanno saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest on early modern scientists william harvey de motu cordis showed that the blood circulated contrary to classical era thinking in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body heat as aristotle thought galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotle physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight on th century thinkers the th century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it was martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotle logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his book the laws of thought this gives logic mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two modern rejection and rehabilitation that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander illustration by during the th century aristotle work was widely criticized the philosopher bertrand russell argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell called aristotle ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceeding so readily to frame theory of such general character on limited evidence from their senses in the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility by the start of the st century however aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best th century scholarship aristotle comes alive as thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans kukkonen observed too that that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current as in the film alexander while the firm rules of aristotle theory of drama have ensured role for the poetics in hollywood biologists continue to be interested in aristotle thinking armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotle biology while niko tinbergen four questions based on aristotle four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny surviving works corpus aristotelicum first page of edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotle lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle school reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekker royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works loss and preservation aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum school aristotle lost works stray considerably in from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication cicero description of aristotle literary style as river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes major question in the history of aristotle works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones we now possess came to us the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy depictions paintings aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent raphael paolo veronese jusepe de ribera rembrandt and francesco hayez over the centuries among the best known depictions is raphael fresco the

an american in paris is jazz influenced orchestral piece by american composer george gershwin first performed in it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the années folles walter damrosch had asked gershwin to write full concerto following the success of rhapsody in blue gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december in carnegie hall with damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic he completed the orchestration on november less than four weeks before the work premiere he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor background although the story is likely apocryphal gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravel unusual chords and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in ready to study with ravel after his initial student audition with ravel turned into sharing of musical theories ravel said he could not teach him saying why be second rate ravel when you can be first rate gershwin gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for tour to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravel friend robert schmitz pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march during party held for ravel birthday by éva gauthier ravel tour reignited gershwin desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel ravel high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after he played for her she told him she could not teach him boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students what could give you that you haven already got this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete new work based on paris and perhaps second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso composition gershwin based an american in paris on melodic fragment called very parisienne written in on his first visit to paris as gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer gershwin called it rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in much more modern idiom than his prior works he described the piece as rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in loose aba format gershwin first episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops third theme in the subito con brio the style of this section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the section andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in faster twelve bar blues in the section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last section that returns to the themes set in after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section in the final grandioso response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damrosch sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his concerto in some did not think it belonged in program with classical composers césar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics it not beethoven symphony you know it humorous piece nothing solemn about it it not intended to draw tears if it pleases symphony audiences as light jolly piece series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds instrumentation an american in paris was originally scored for flutes rd doubling on piccolo oboes english horn clarinets in flat bass clarinet in flat bassoons contrabassoon horns in trumpets in flat trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block ratchet cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta taxi horns labeled as and with circles around them alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones and strings although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes and it has recently come to light that gershwin intention was to have used the notes and it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as and with circles he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played major revision of the work by composer and arranger campbell watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto tenor and baritone the soprano saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments and the contrabassoon was also deleted this became the standard performing edition until when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwin original manuscript including the restoration of gershwin soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell watson revision gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at london queen elizabeth hall on july by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian william daly arranged the score for piano solo this was published by new world music in preservation status on september it was announced that musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin true intent it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster bar blues section or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwin composition process the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in series of scores to be released the entire project was expected take to years to complete but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher note music in the changes made by campbell watson were withdrawn in both editions in the extended urtext bars of music were re integrated conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance on september the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the long awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan this performance was of the original orchestration except that it upheld the deletion of the contrabassoon part an alteration usually attributed to campbell watson recordings first recording an american in paris has been frequently recorded the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the

television the tony awards for theater and the grammy awards for music are modeled after the academy awards they are widely cited as the most famous and prestigious competitive awards in the field of entertainment the nd academy awards ceremony honoring the best films of was held on february as with the previous ceremony there was no host the ceremony was broadcast on abc it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles california for the th consecutive year this ceremony marked the first time in oscar history that more than three films had received ten or more nominations total of oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in history the first academy awards presentation was held on may at private dinner function at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about people the post awards party was held at the mayfair hotel the cost of guest tickets for that night ceremony was in dollars fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film making industry of the time for their works during the period the ceremony ran for minutes winners were announced to media three months earlier that was changed for the second ceremony in since then for the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at pm on the night of the awards this method was used until when the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as result the academy has since used sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners milestones the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history at that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in certain category during the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for specific performance in single film for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years at the th ceremony held in the best foreign language film category now known as best international feature film was introduced until then foreign language films had been honored with the special achievement award perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was year old robert opel who streaked across the stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles flashing peace sign on national us television at the th academy awards in bemused host david niven quipped isn it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings later evidence arose suggesting that opel appearance was facilitated as publicity stunt by the show producer jack haley jr robert metzler the show business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some way during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzler wife to borrow pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the ad lib it appeared to be the th academy awards held in presented the first academy award for best animated feature since all academy awards ceremonies have ended with the academy award for best picture traditionally the previous year winner for best actor and best supporting actor present the awards for best actress and best supporting actress while the previous year winner for best actress and best supporting actress present the awards for best actor and best supporting actor parasite became the first foreign language film to win best picture at the february award ceremony tom hanks announced at the oscar ceremony the opening of the academy museum of motion pictures on december the

david rubin and ceo dawn hudson announced that for the oscar ceremony streaming movies not shown in theaters would be eligible though at some point the requirement that movies be shown in theaters would return oscar statuette academy award of merit oscar statuette the best known award is the academy award of merit more popularly known as the oscar statuette made of gold plated bronze on black metal base it is in cm tall weighs lb kg and depicts knight rendered in art deco style holding crusader sword standing on reel of film with five spokes the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians sculptor george stanley who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl sculpted cedric gibbons design the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold plated solid bronze within few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal pewter like alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally karat gold due to metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold plated metal ones the only addition to the oscar since it was created is minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in at the shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award statuettes from to approximately oscars in tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer owens company it would take between three and four weeks to manufacture statuettes in the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes handing manufacturing duties to walden new york based polich tallix fine art foundry while based on digital scan of an original oscar the statuettes retain their modern era dimensions and black pedestal cast in liquid bronze from printed ceramic molds and polished they are then electroplated in karat gold by brooklyn new york based epner technology the time required to produce such statuettes is roughly three months owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating naming the academy officially adopted the name oscar for the trophies in however the origin of the nickname is disputed one biography of bette davis who was president of the academy in claims she named the award after her first husband band leader harmon oscar nelson frequently mentioned originator is margaret herrick the academy executive secretary who when she first saw the award in said the statuette reminded her of uncle oscar nickname for her cousin oscar pierce columnist sidney skolsky who was present during herrick naming in wrote that employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar the academy credits skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to oscar in his column on march which was written about that year th academy awards the awards appeared again in another early media mention of oscar time magazine story in the ceremonies that year walt disney was the first to thank the academy for his oscar during his acceptance speech engraving to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates until winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars since winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription processing station at the governor ball party held immediately after the oscar ceremony the owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony bearing the name of every potential winner the nameplates for the non winning nominees are later recycled ownership of oscar statuettes prior to oscar statuettes were and remain the property of the recipient since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the academy for us if winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette academy awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums in michael todd grandson tried to sell todd best picture oscar for his production of around the world in days to movie prop collector the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining permanent injunction against the sale in harold russell consigned his oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction in order to raise money for his wife medical expenses though his decision caused controversy the first ever oscar to be sold passed to private collector on august for today russell defended his action saying don know why anybody would be critical my wife health is much more important than sentimental reasons the movie will be here even if oscar isn in december orson welles oscar for citizen kane academy award for best original screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy on december it sold in an

its membership although as recently as press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join the release also stated that it has just under voting members while the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then in the results of study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately

advising its or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in rules according to rules and of the official academy awards rules film must open in the previous

feature film best documentary feature and awards in short film categories additionally the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between pm and pm local time the best international feature film award does not require release it requires the film to be submitted as its country official selection the best documentary feature award requires either week long releases in both los angeles county and new york city during the previous calendar year or qualifying award at competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list regardless of any public exhibition or distribution or submission in the international feature film category as its country official selection the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings additionally film must have been reviewed by critic from the new york times time out new york the los angeles times or la weekly awards in short film categories best documentary short subject best animated short film and best live action short film have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards first the qualifying period for release does not coincide with calendar year instead covering one year period starting on october and ending on september of the calendar year before the ceremony second there are multiple methods of qualification the main method is week long theatrical release in either los angeles county or new york city during the eligibility period films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of number of competitive film festivals designated by the academy also without regard to prior public distribution finally film that is selected as gold silver or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible documentary category for that award and animation narrative alternative or international for the other awards the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards only one screening per day is required for the documentary award the screening must start between noon and pm local time for other awards no specific start time is required but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times for example the best picture winner the hurt locker was actually first released in but did not qualify for the awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid thus qualifying for the awards foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year rule states that film must be feature length defined as minimum of minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on mm or mm film print or in frame or frame progressive scan digital cinema format with minimum projector resolution of by pixels since the th academy awards presented in multi part and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award this followed the win of made in america an eight hour presentation that was screened in limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn in that category in the academy announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year the form includes the production credits for all related categories then each form is checked and put in reminder list of eligible releases in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around active members for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees in all major categories variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting ballot with up to five nominees ten for best picture ranked preferentially in certain categories including international feature film documentary and animated feature nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members since the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting since re weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders for example producer of the best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front runner the hurt locker eventually won awards ceremonies telecast pantages theatre hollywood st academy awards presentations dolby theatre hollywood the major awards are presented at live televised ceremony commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast the academy awards is the world longest running awards show televised live from the to all time zones in north america and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world the oscars were first televised in by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until when abc took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in through nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in and its current contract with the academy runs through the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in countries decade later the rights were already being sold to countries and by the tv rights to the awards were licensed in countries the ceremonies were moved up from late march early april to late february since to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience in and abc regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite nbc ncaa title game the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid clash with the winter olympic games another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been grievance from members and the general public advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmys in history with wins and nominations overall since that award own launch in after many years of being held on mondays at pm eastern pacific since the ceremonies it was moved to sundays at pm et pm pt the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier for many years the film industry opposed sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office in the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industry long awards season however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail furthermore january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games in the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the nd academy awards in originally scheduled for april the th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march the rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington in an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months selection compiled by small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead this segment was later followed by commercial break in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and half hours the first oscars in lasted minutes at the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and twenty three minutes in the organizers of the academy awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past seconds this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion in in further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an on screen ticker during the ceremony host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give brand new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night reward won by mark bridges when accepting his best costume design award for phantom thread the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the telecasts as follows on song performances on the hosts speeches on prerecorded clips and on the awards themselves broken into on the introduction and announcement on winners walking to the stage and on their acceptance speeches although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped the th academy awards were the lowest rated in the past eight years although with increases in male and viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions in august ampas extended its contract with abc through the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast tv ratings historically the telecast viewership is higher when box office hits are favored to win the best picture award more than million viewers tuned to the telecast for the th academy awards in the year of titanic which generated box office haul during its initial run of us million in the us box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years the th academy awards ceremony in which the lord of the rings the return of the king pre telecast box office earnings of us million received awards including best picture drew million viewers the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the nd academy awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew household rating on april by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critically acclaimed those films have been the th academy awards which awarded low budget independent film crash with pre oscar gross of us million generated an audience of million with household rating of in the th academy awards telecast was watched by million viewers on average with an household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating years of the academy awards the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film no country for old men the nd academy awards drew an average of million viewers new low archive the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the oscars and material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows copies are held on variety of film video and digital formats venues in the first academy awards were presented at banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel from to the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles grauman chinese theatre in

new york first at the nbc international theatre and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california in by the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center in the late and early the ceremony returned to the shrine in hollywood dolby theatre previously known as the kodak theatre became the presentation current venue awards of merit categories current categories in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two categories drama and comedy at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and comedy musical from the through the the art direction now production design cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories black and white films and color films prior to the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup in august the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony following dissent from academy members they announced that they would indeed air all categories live this followed number of proposals among them the introduction of popular film category that the academy had announced but did not implement discontinued categories proposed categories the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories to date the following categories have been proposed best casting rejected in best popular film proposed in for presentation at the ceremony postponed until the ceremony at the earliest best stunt coordination rejected every year from to best title design rejected in special categories the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as whole they are not always presented on an annual basis current special categories academy honorary award since academy scientific and technical award three different awards since gordon sawyer award since jean hersholt humanitarian award since irving thalberg memorial award since academy special achievement award from to and again for discontinued special categories academy juvenile award to criticism accusations of commercialism due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at conference in new york in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself tim dirks editor of amc filmsite org has written of the academy awards recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history accusations of bias typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the the last three months of the calendar year the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues allegations of lack of diversity the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since which shows us that only of academy award nominees have been non white and since of nominees have been non white with the rate of winners being even more polarizing more white actresses have won oscars for yellowface portrayals of asian characters than actual asian actresses the th awards ceremony became the target of boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite based on critics perception that its all white acting nominee list reflected bias in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by the year symbolism or acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for snub for work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one actually awarded or presented as career honor to recognize distinguished nominee entire body of work recognition of streaming media film following the st academy awards in february in which the netflix broadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services spielberg had been concerned that netflix as movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscar winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picture nominated films while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical run status to qualify for an oscar the united states department of justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote letter to the academy in march cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti trust concerns against the academy following its april board meeting the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs refusals of the award some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols best writing in for the informer nichols boycotted the th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild nichols eventually accepted the award three years later at the ceremony nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career george scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in for patton at the rd academy awards ceremony scott described it as meat parade saying don want any part of it the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando who refused his award best actor for the godfather citing the film industry discrimination and mistreatment of native americans at the th academy awards ceremony brando sent actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read page speech detailing his criticisms which was booed by the audience incidents at the th academy awards ceremony warren beatty and faye dunaway mistakenly announced la la land as the recipient of the best picture award instead of moonlight the actual winner beatty had been given the wrong envelope and after hesitating during the announcement handed the envelope to dunaway which listed emma stone as best actress for la la land and led to the confusion the proper winner was announced after the acceptance speeches by la la land producers fred berger jordan horowitz and marc platt the following year beatty and dunaway

international atomic time tai from the french name is high precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earth geoid it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time with fixed offset of epoch it is also the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth surface when another leap second was added tai is exactly seconds ahead of utc the seconds results from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in utc since tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth operation tai is weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units si definition of the second is based on caesium the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock the participating institutions each broadcast in real time frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by well known integer number of seconds these time scales are denoted in the form utc npl in the utc form where npl in this case identifies the national physical laboratory uk the tai form may be denoted tai npl the latter is not to be confused with ta npl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible this combined time scale is published monthly in circular and is the canonical tai this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc equivalent to tai tai for each participating institution the same circular also gives tables of tai ta for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales errors in publication may be corrected by issuing revision of the faulty circular or by errata in subsequent circular aside from this once published in circular the tai scale is not revised in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating better realisation of terrestrial time tt history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl it was used as basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish time scale called greenwich atomic ga the united states naval observatory began the scale on september using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on october the international time bureau bih began time scale tm or am in july using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the bih scale and nbs were defined by an epoch at the beginning of the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed in and ta bih in the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in from to the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made series of decisions which designated the bipm time scale international atomic time tai in the it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from julian date january corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd january exactly at that instant tai was henceforth realisation of tt with the equation tt tai tai the continued existence of tai was questioned in letter from the bipm to the itu which stated in the case of redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc relation to utc utc is discontinuous time scale it is regularly adjusted by leap seconds between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time from its beginning in through december the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut afterward these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut this was compromise arrangement in order to enable publicly broadcast time scale the less frequent whole second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally the fact that it continues to approximate ut means that tasks such as navigation which require source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc see also clock synchronization network time protocol precision time protocol

giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or animals resulting in quality of life both material and spiritual it is traditional virtue in many cultures and core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions in an extreme case altruism may become synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of selfishness the word altruism was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at cost to themselves pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action steinberg suggests definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards in one sense the opposite of altruism is spite spiteful action harms another with no self benefit altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others the notion of altruism the concept has long history in philosophical and ethical thought the term was originally coined in the th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them scientific viewpoints anthropology marcel mauss book the gift contains passage called note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice in it he writes alms are the fruits of moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of notion of sacrifice on the other generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become principle of justice the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children evolutionary explanations giving alms to beggar children in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies some of the proposed mechanisms are kin selection that animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior one kinship cue is facial resemblance one study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helpful behavior another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in group using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study this effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families vested interests people are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness extreme self sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup reciprocal altruism see also reciprocity evolution direct reciprocity research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is chance that they can and will reciprocate the help the effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example many people seem to be following similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return one consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future people tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower they tend to help less if they see non cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors simply changing the cooperative framing of proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it community game instead of wall street game tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them this has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity another method is to announce publicly that someone has given large donation the tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped on the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating people sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts as such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have slightly generous interpretation of non cooperation people are more likely to cooperate on task if they can communicate with one another first this may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises they are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately direct reciprocity and cooperation in group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individual performance relative to small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group indirect reciprocity the avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes person reputation to become very important person with good reputation for reciprocity has higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously strong reciprocity form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence pseudo reciprocity an organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in way that is selfish but also as byproduct benefits the altruist costly signaling and the handicap principle since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources this may signal to others that the altruist is valuable potential partner it may also be signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling it is unclear if costly signaling can indicate long term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one resources heroic risk taking has also been interpreted as costly signal of ability volunteers assist hurricane victims at the houston astrodome following hurricane katrina both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions one is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else this have been documented in many studies the effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of logo on computer screen weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by desire to be seen as altruistic people who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners when looking for long term partner altruism may be preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children it has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman while both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man men may even avoid altruistic women in short term relationships which may be because they expect less success people may compete for social benefit from burnished reputation which may cause competitive altruism on the other hand in some experiments proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous this may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic the reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present while humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs benefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards this may be because such extrinsic top down incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them this may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are non cooperators counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all group selection it has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as david sloan wilson that natural selection can act at the level of non kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit non kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members see also in group favoritism group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists homeless in new york city such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment this need not imply that on average or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george price development of the price equation which is mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his book mutual aid factor of evolution and peter singer in his book darwinian left neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs or hospital network provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species altruism the experiment suggested was not superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable one brain region the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex basal forebrain contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in those with trait empathy the same study has shown connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding in fact in an experiment published in march at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that when confronted with moral dilemmas these brain damaged patients coldly came up with end justifies the means answers leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by difficult issue in this case as whether to shoot down passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits major city these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains according to adrian raine clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california one of this study implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability in another study in the dr bill harbaugh university of oregon economist concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in similar fmri scanner test in with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions of jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity such as person environment and values psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as motivational state with the goal of increasing another welfare psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one own welfare there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism some definitions specify self sacrificial nature to altruism and lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self daniel batson is psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory he identified four major motives to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit group collectivism or to uphold moral principle principlism altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless the empathy altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another suffering helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues peace corps trainees swearing in as volunteers in cambodia april in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person distress research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility however witness with high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well being in study of older adults those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live and lower in depression anxiety and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over year period and found that of those who did not belong to volunteer organization experienced major illness while only of those who did volunteer experienced one study on adults ages found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for reduction in mortality merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states studies have also been careful to note that feeling over taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had positive one although positive effects were still significant additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others studies suggest that gratitude goes hand in hand with kindness and is also very important for our well being study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well being sociology sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society altruism morality and social solidarity american sociological association the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is largely researched topic within the field the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society the motivation of altruism is also the focus of study some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims studies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious people imitate observed generosity of others pathological altruism pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or well intentioned actions cause more harm than good the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid religious viewpoints most if not all of the world religions promote altruism as very important moral value buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality buddhism monks collecting alms altruism figures prominently in buddhism love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama still the notion of altruism is modified in such world view since the belief is that such practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes dalai lama in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like natural law of cause and effect simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as natural consequence one would experience happiness jainism sculpture depicting the jain concept of ahimsa non injury the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings jainism preaches the view of ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings uncompromising reverence for all life it also considers all living things to be equal the first tirthankara rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things jainism prescribes path of non violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors one unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by and greed by contentment jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks they are non violence ahimsa truthfulness satya non stealing asteya celibacy brahmacharya non possession or non materialism aparigraha the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders the house holders are encouraged to practice the above mentioned five vows the monks have to observe them very strictly with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress the principle of non violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha god in jainism because all living beings possess soul great care and awareness is essential in one actions jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders christianity altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain from biblical to medieval christian traditions tensions between self affirmation and other regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests in his book indoctrination and self deception roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self affirmation and altruism by analysis of other regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person experience and practice from within as in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others considering that the love with which man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of part however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude more desirable thing than bodily well being in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism many biblical authors draw strong connection between love of others and love of god john states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one fellowman is the same as hatred of god thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love an altruistic action is not always loving action oord defines altruism as acting for the other good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one own good when the other demands undermine overall well being german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak one way is sincere expression of christian love motivated by powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one own life and existence another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people business at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse islam in islam the concept ithaar إيثار altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be demand made by allah god on the human body considered to be property of allah alone the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in thar attention is focused on everything in existence constant concern for allah results in careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like rabia al adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah and dedication to people thirteenth century turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as yaratılanı severiz yaratandan ötürü or we love the creature because of the creator for many muslims thar must be practiced as religious obligation during specific islamic holidays however thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity this is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework ashlag proposed that such framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness the concept of seva or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in sikhism the fifth nanak guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth the ninth guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh ji the tenth guru in sikhism was in war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji and complained of his action that they considered counter productive to their struggle on the battlefield what were you doing and why asked the guru was giving water to the wounded because saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded volunteer corps for altruism this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same hinduism in hinduism selflessness atmatyag love prema kindness daya and forgiveness kshama are considered as the highest acts of humanity or manushyattva giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as divine act or punya and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or paapa and will led them to heaven or swarga in afterlife altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs swami vivekananda the legendary hindu monk has said jive prem kare jeijon seijon sebiche iswar whoever loves any living being is serving god mass donation of clothes to poor people vastraseva or blood donation camp or mass food donation annaseva for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremonies swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras vedantic text in his commentary on chapter of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short lived and ceases to exist as soon as deed is executed hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at future date according to one merit furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit since apurva is non sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as god it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment however the very well known and popular text the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga achieving oneness with god through action nishkaama karma or action without expectation desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality philosophy there exists wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co inhabitants related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one self interest without specifying how this affects one moral obligations effective altruism effective altruism is philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact based upon their values it is the broad evidence based and cause neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence based practices while substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects companies and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives help people or

the objectivist movement itself as cult or religion rand expressed opinions on wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers however some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among rand closest followers in new york rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her later years throughout the and rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale

rand and several more of her closest associates parted company rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in after decades of heavy smoking in she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections she allowed social worker evva pryor an employee of her attorney to enroll her in social security and medicare during the late her activities within the objectivist movement declined

new york city and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york rand funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan floral arrangement in the shape of dollar sign was placed near her casket in her will rand named leonard peikoff to inherit her estate philosophy rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man senses she rejected all claims of non perceptual or priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational self interest as the guiding moral principle she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself she referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of man survival qua man she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites rand political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship rand believed that natural rights should be protected by limited government although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics she denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism she rejected anarchism as naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice in aesthetics rand defined art as selective re creation of reality according to an artist metaphysical value judgments according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling need of human consciousness as writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will she described her own approach to literature as romantic realism rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three aristotle aquinas and ayn rand in interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me devised the rest of my philosophy myself however she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rand journals in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style however by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsche ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed rand considered her philosophical opposite to be immanuel kant whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankind history primarily for his philosophy regarding the limitations of reason rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts ethics and discovery in politics that evil the violation of rights consists of the initiation of force she believed epistemology was foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows reception and legacy critical reception during rand lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation rand first novel we the living was admired by the literary critic mencken her broadway play night of january th was both critical and popular success and the fountainhead was hailed by the new york times reviewer lorine pruette as masterful rand novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic however they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth the first reviews rand received were for night of january th reviews of the production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer rand believed that her first novel we the living was not widely reviewed but rand scholar michael berliner writes it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately different reviews being published in more than publications overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work her novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues rand first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed lorine pruette positive review in the new york times was one that rand greatly appreciated pruette called rand writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it whale of book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves stern lecture on paper rationing other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rand style offensively pedestrian rand novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative in national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly he described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused rand of supporting godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to gas chamber go atlas shrugged received positive reviews from few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in contest to devise the cleverest put downs calling it execrable claptrap and nightmare they also said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity rand nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers in on the th anniversary of rand birth edward rothstein writing for the new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society in book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with patina of pseudo philosophy in gq critic columnist tom carson described her books as capitalism version of middlebrow religious novels such as ben hur and the left behind series reviewing the posthumously published novel ideal the new york times chief book critic michiko kakutani assessed rand didactic ideological work as stylistically having great deal in common with the message minded socialist realism produced in the soviet union which she left in the mid and vociferously denounced popular interest the american adventure rotunda at walt disney world epcot in survey conducted for the library of congress and the book of the month club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent life was rand atlas shrugged was

william buckley jr and other contributors for the national review magazine they published numerous criticisms in the and by whittaker chambers garry wills and stanton evans nevertheless her influence

lives and have recommended her novels the financial crisis of spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis opinion articles compared real world events with the plot of the novel during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan for example mother jones remarked that rand particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while equating randian individual well being with that of the volk according to goebbels corey robin of the nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of randianism and fascism academic reaction scholarly reception during rand lifetime during rand lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars when the first academic book about rand philosophy appeared in its author declared writing about rand treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously few articles about rand ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in many of them in the personalist one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is ought problem posed by david hume other philosophers writing in the same publication argued that nozick misstated rand case academic consideration of rand as literary figure during her life was even more limited academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rand novels when she began researching her in and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the posthumous overall assessments since rand death interest in her work has gradually increased in historian jennifer burns identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand including an explosion of scholarship since the year however as of that same year few universities included rand or objectivism as philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as pop culture phenomenon rather than subject for serious study writing in the edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran kukathas summarizes the mainstream philosophical reception to her work in two parts her ethical argument he says is viewed by most commentators as an unconvincing variant of aristotle ethics her political theory he says is of little interest marred by an ill thought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism libertarian philosopher michael huemer argues that very few people find rand ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence he attributes the attention she receives to her being compelling writer especially as novelist noting that atlas shrugged outsells rand non fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic bastiat several critics claim that the novel what is to be done by russian author nikolay chernyshevsky is an embodiment of rational egoism and one of the sources of inspiration for rand thought for example the book main character lopuhov says am not man to make sacrifices and indeed there are no such things one acts in the way that one finds most pleasant regarding rand particular disdain for the philosophy of immanuel kant philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences political scientist charles murray while praising rand literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation rand specific

published by cambridge university press rand ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional political writer and rand scholar jack wheeler writes that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rand ethics are most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought objectivist movement in rand intellectual heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute

turn derives from the arabic the islands truncated form of the older islands of the mazghanna tribe employed by medieval geographers such as al idrisi history prehistory and ancient history roman ruins at djémila in the region of ain hanech saïda province early remnants bc of hominid occupation in north africa were found neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles bc similar to those in the levant algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques tools of this era starting about bc are called aterian after the archaeological site of bir el ater south of tebessa the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in the oran region this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between and bc neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as bc or as late as between and bc this life richly depicted in the tassili ajjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa roman ruins of timgadon the street leading to the local arch of trajan from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by bc phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilisation was already at stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organisation supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others by the early th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from to bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthage north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars in bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew by the nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the nd century bc numidia along with egypt rome and carthage bc after masinissa death in bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times masinissa line survived until ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius modern day annaba algeria located in the roman province of africa the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in and by controlled coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival middle ages mansourah mosque tlemcen after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the early th century dihya memorial in khenchela algeria large numbers of the indigenous berber people converted to islam christians berber and latin speakers remained in the great majority in tunisia until the end of the th century and muslims only became vast majority some time in the th after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the rustamids aghlabids fatimids zirids hammadids almoravids almohads and the abdalwadid the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest in the th century and the th the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the th century during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari and the emirs abd al mu min and yāghmūrasen it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting secular inner government as well as powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic tāghribāt in al tāghrībāt the amazigh zirid hero khālīfā al zānatī asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero ābu zayd al hilalī and many other arab knights in string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era shia ismaili dynasty that ruled much of north africa the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houara zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisions several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun provides table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid banu ifran maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties the berber almohad caliphate at its greatest extent there reigned in ifriqiya current tunisia berber family zirid somehow recognising the suzerainty of the fatimid caliph of cairo probably in the zirid ruler or viceroy el mu izz decided to end this suzerainty the fatimid state was too weak to attempt punitive expedition the viceroy el mu izz also found another means of revenge between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot the then fatimid vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign this not only prompted the bedouins to leave but the fatimid treasury even gave them light expatriation cash allowance whole tribes set off with women children ancestors animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but with each encounter the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the field the flood was still rising and in the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they gradually choked qalaa of banu hammad as they had done in kairouan few decades ago from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some were forcibly taken by the almohads in the second half of the th century we can say that in the th century the arabs were in all of north africa with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions which remained entirely berber the influx of bedouin tribes was major factor in the linguistic cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal tribes had become completely arid desert in the early th century spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the algerian coast spain took control of few coastal towns like mers el kebir in oran in and tlemcen mostaganem and ténès in in the same year few merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to spain which built fort on it the presidios in north africa turned out to be costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for spain merchant fleet ottoman era zayyanid kingdom of tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbors the region of algeria was partially ruled by ottomans for three centuries from to in the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region forcing the previous ruler abu hamo musa iii of the bani ziyad dynasty to flee when aruj was killed in during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and contingent of some janissaries with the aid of this force hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until hayreddin barbarossa the next beylerbey was hayreddin son hasan who assumed the position in until the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits subsequently with the institution of regular ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms the pasha was assisted by janissaries known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha as result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa algiers lost from to inhabitants to the plague in and suffered high fatalities in and in the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power the new leader received the title of dey after the right to select the dey passed to the divan council of some sixty nobles it was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the th century it had become the dey instrument in the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role although algiers remained part of the ottoman empire the dey was in effect constitutional autocrat the dey was elected for life term but in the years that the system survived fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of ottoman government was remarkably orderly although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regency authority was seldom applied in the kabylie christian slaves in algiers the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves they also did brisk business in ransoming some of the captives according to robert davis from the th to th century pirates captured million to million europeans as slaves they often made raids called razzias on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire in for example hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia taking prisoners and enslaved some inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population in the ottoman governor of algiers turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera the introduction of broad sail ships from the beginning of the th century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic bombardment of algiers by the anglo dutch fleet to support the ultimatum to release european slaves august in july two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria in pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as result the spanish navy bombarded algiers in and for the attack in the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as naples portugal and the knights of malta over cannonballs were fired much of the city and its fortifications were destroyed and most of the algerian fleet was sunk in the th century the pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying licence tax in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the united states initiating the first and second barbary wars following those wars algeria was weaker and europeans with an anglo dutch fleet commanded by the british lord exmouth attacked algiers after nine hour bombardment they obtained treaty from the dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by captain later commodore stephen decatur navy concerning the demands of tributes in addition the dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving christians despite being removed from algeria in the th century spain retained presence in morocco algeria consistently opposed spanish fortresses and control in nearby morocco through the th century french colonization battle of somah in under the pretext of slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by the french conquest was complete the war had killed approximately indigenous algerians since french losses from to were dead in the hospital and only killed in action the population of algeria which stood at about million in reached nearly million in french policy was predicated on civilizing the country the slave trade and piracy in algeria ceased following the french conquest the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one third from to during this period small but influential french speaking indigenous elite was formed made up of berbers mostly kabyles as consequence french government favored the kabyles about of indigenous schools were constructed for kabyles emir abdelkader algerian leader insurgent against french colonial rule from until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation one of france longest held overseas territories algeria became destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as pied noirs between and french people emigrated to algeria these settlers benefited from the french government confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early th century they formed majority of the population in both cities the six historical leaders of the fln rabah bitat mostefa ben boulaïd didouche mourad mohammed boudiaf krim belkacem and larbi ben hidi during the late th and early th century the european share was almost fifth of the population the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and relatively human capital intensive agriculture on july the british royal navy attacked the french navy fleet at mers el kébir killing nearly men with the goal of preventing the french warships from falling into german hands on november allied forces launched operation torch landing in various places across french north africa gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france in may the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the sétif and guelma massacre tensions between the two population groups came to head in when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began historians have estimated that between and harkis and their dependants were killed by the front de libération nationale fln or by lynch mobs in algeria the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around the war uprooted more than million algerians the war against french rule concluded in when algeria gained complete independence following the march evian agreements and the july self determination referendum some estimates put the algerian death toll during the french colonial rule at over million the first three decades of independence the number of european pied noirs who fled algeria totaled more than between and the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city and began attacking civilians houari boumediene algeria first president was the front de libération nationale fln leader ahmed ben bella morocco claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in ben bella was overthrown in by houari boumédiène his former ally and defence minister under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian boumédienne continued this trend but he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to symbolic role he collectivised agriculture and launched massive drive oil extraction facilities were nationalised this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international oil crisis in the and under president houari boumediene algeria pursued program of within state controlled socialist economy boumediene successor chadli bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life teachers of arabic brought in from other muslim countries spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of return to orthodox islam the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the oil glut economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the by the end of the decade bendjedid introduced multi party system political parties developed such as the islamic salvation front fis broad coalition of muslim groups civil war and aftermath massacres of over people in the armed islamic group gia claimed responsibility for many of them in december the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections fearing the election of an islamist government the authorities intervened on january cancelling the elections bendjedid resigned and high council of state was installed to act as the presidency it banned the fis triggering civil insurgency between the front armed wing the armed islamic group and the national armed forces in which more than people are thought to have died the islamist militants conducted violent campaign of civilian massacres at several points in the conflict the situation in algeria became point of international concern most notably during the crisis surrounding air france flight hijacking perpetrated by the armed islamic group the armed islamic group declared ceasefire in october algeria held elections in considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced civil concord

indigenous american people anthropology is the scientific study of humanity concerned with human behavior human biology and societies in both the present and past including past human species social anthropology studies patterns of behaviour while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning including norms and values linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans visual anthropology which is usually considered to be part of social anthropology can mean both ethnographic film where photography film and new media are used for study as well as the study of visuals including art visual images cinema etc oxford bibliographies describes visual anthropology as the anthropological study of the visual and the visual study of the anthropological archaeology which studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence is considered branch of anthropology in the united states and canada while in europe it is viewed as discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines such as history origin and development of the term bernardino de sahagún is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology the abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann their new latin derived from the combining forms of the greek words ánthrōpos human and lógos study its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early th century through the th century in the bartholins founders of the university of copenhagen defined as follows sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by étienne serres in to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of chair in anthropology and ethnography in at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau various short lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the société ethnologique de paris the first to use ethnology was formed in its members were primarily anti slavery activists when slavery was abolished in france in the société was abandoned meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in as well as the ethnological society of london in break away group of the aborigines protection society these anthropologists of the times were liberal anti slavery and pro human rights activists they maintained international connections anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier th century theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy linguistics and ethnology making feature by feature comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then for them the publication of charles darwin on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect anthropologists generally regard herodotus greek historian who lived in the bc as the first thinker to write widely on concepts that would later become central to anthropology darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the société anthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature broca being what today would be called neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called broca area after him his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six volume work entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples the last two volumes were published posthumously waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man following broca lead waitz points out that anthropology is new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men waitz was influential among the british ethnologists in the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology it was the nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence representatives from the french société were present though not broca in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as standard among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor geologist previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid the american anthropological association in the anthropological society of vienna the italian society of anthropology and ethnology and many others subsequently the majority of these were evolutionist one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology ethnology and prehistory founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists not religious himself he insisted that darwin conclusions lacked empirical foundation during the last three decades of the th century proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association the major theorists belonged to these organizations they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning by educational institutions in countries had some curriculum in anthropology none of the faculty members were under department named anthropology th and st centuries this meager statistic expanded in the th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world higher educational institutions many thousands in number anthropology has diversified from few major subdivisions to dozens more practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene the organization has reached global level for example the world council of anthropological associations wcaa network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late th and early th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross cultural comparisons long term in depth examination of context and the importance they place on participant observation or experiential immersion in the area of research cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against th century racial ideology through margaret mead advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of post colonial oppression and promotion of ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology and archaeology plus anthropological linguistics these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology term coined and defined by adam kollár in it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition fields anthropology is global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity such as by al biruni of the islamic golden age as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late th century fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as shift toward the analysis of modern societies during the and there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy central place in cultural and social anthropology in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist due to this difference in epistemology the four sub fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades sociocultural sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts how one culture affects the experience for self and group contributing to more complete understanding of the people knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history in that it helps develop an understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations such as minorities subgroups dissidents etc there is no hard and fast distinction between them and these categories overlap to considerable degree inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross cultural comparison this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography ethnography can refer to both methodology and the product of ethnographic research an ethnographic monograph as methodology ethnography is based upon long term fieldwork within community or other research site participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures the process of participant observation can be especially helpful to understanding culture from an emic conceptual vs etic or technical point of view the study of kinship and social organization is central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is human universal sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology comparison across cultures is key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized and de industrialized west the standard cross cultural sample sccs includes such cultures biological forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains such as these found lying in scrub in western australia biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non human primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation archaeological archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices is type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways the rosetta stone was an example of ancient communication linguistic linguistic anthropology not to be confused with anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and non verbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis key topics by field sociocultural art media music dance and film art one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as cultural phenomenon several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in significantly different form in most non western contexts to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities boas primitive art claude lévi strauss the way of the masks or geertz art as cultural system are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics media punu tribe mask gabon central africa media anthropology also known as the anthropology of media or mass media emphasizes ethnographic studies as means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media other types include cyber anthropology relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early music ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire ethnomusicology can be used in wide variety of fields such as teaching politics cultural anthropology etc while the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the th and th centuries it was formally introduced as ethnomusicology by dutch scholar jaap kunst around later the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ethnomusicology and the society of ethnomusicology visual visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid new media while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology economic political economic applied and development economic economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope it has complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical its origins as sub field of anthropology begin with the polish british founder of anthropology bronisław malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of gift giving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective political economy political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to non capitalist societies political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture three main areas of interest rapidly developed the first of these areas was concerned with the pre capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes sahlin work on hunter gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist world system more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and post industrial capitalism around the world applied applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems it is complex of related research based instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action and or the formulation of policy more simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community it is closely related to development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology of development development anthropology of development tends to view development from critical perspective the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why if key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship feminism gender and sexuality kinship kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves over its history anthropology has developed number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent one social relations during development and also relatives by marriage within kinship you have two different families people have their biological families and it is the people they share dna with this is called consanguineal relations or blood ties people can also have chosen family finding connection through chosen family in which they chose who they want to be part of their family in some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families feminist feminist anthropology is four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge anthropology engages often with feminists from non western traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as specialization the first african american female anthropologist and caribbeanist is said to be vera mae green who studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states and thereby tried to improve the way black life experiences and culture were studied medical nutritional psychological cognitive and transpersonal medical medical anthropology is an field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as whole it focuses on the following six basic fields other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering farmer beneduce as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not result of illness on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry nutritional nutritional anthropology is synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter if economic and environmental changes in community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people psychological psychological anthropology is an subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within particular cultural group with its own history language practices and conceptual categories shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes cognitive cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them transpersonal transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness asc and transpersonal experience however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross cultural issues for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences political and legal political political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies political anthropology developed as discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies new development started from the and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels firstly anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state regulated sphere as in patron client relations or tribal political organization secondly anthropologists slowly started to develop disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions an anthropology of the state developed and it is most thriving field today geertz comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example legal legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the cross cultural study of social ordering earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings public public anthropology was created by robert borofsky professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change nature science and technology cyborg cyborg anthropology originated as sub focus group within the american anthropological association annual meeting in the sub group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science donna haraway cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings digital digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture the field is new and thus has variety of names with variety of emphases these include techno anthropology digital ethnography and virtual anthropology ecological ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments the sub field is also defined as the study of relationships between population of humans and their biophysical environment the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how their environments change across space and time the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues century anthropology and more the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly organizing participation or indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park historical ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names religion the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is cultural product created by the human community that worships it urban urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism ulf hannerz quotes remark that traditional anthropologists were notoriously agoraphobic lot anti urban by definition various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes there are two main approaches to urban anthropology examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city key topics by field archaeological and biological anthrozoology anthrozoology also known as human animal studies is the study of interaction between living things it is an field that overlaps with number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions it includes scholars from diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy biocultural biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the th century viewed this relationship from racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology evolutionary evolutionary anthropology is the study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non hominin primates evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present it is based on scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics it is dynamic and field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present forensic forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victim remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to court of law five of the seven known fossil teeth of homo luzonensis found in callao cave combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field markers on specimens such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations organizations contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association aaa which was founded in its members are anthropologists from around the globe in group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists easa which serves as major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of global anthropology or world anthropology hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub fields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well list of major organizations american anthropological association american ethnological society asociación de antropólogos iberoamericanos en red aibr moving anthropology

sciences society for applied anthropology usc center for visual anthropology ethics as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves and professional societies have generated codes of ethics anthropologists like other researchers especially historians and scientists engaged in field research have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism some commentators have contended that the discipline grew out of colonialism perhaps was in league with it and derives some of its key notions from it consciously or not see for example gough pels and salemink but cf lewis that ethnographic work is often ahistorical writing about people as if they were out of time in an ethnographic present johannes fabian time and its other cultural relativism as part of their quest for scientific objectivity present day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the sub fields of anthropology this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man inhumanity to man to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor sub fields military involvement anthropologists involvement with the government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war and after the war he published brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists but by the many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis powers nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence for example office of strategic services and the office of war information at the same time david price work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little many anthropologists students and teachers were active in the antiwar movement numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association aaa professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth asa has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous the principles of professional responsibility issued by the american anthropological association and amended through november stated that in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given the current principles of professional responsibility does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us army strategy in afghanistan the christian science monitor reports that efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system hts program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq in the american anthropological association commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions not subject to external review where data collection occurs in the context of war integrated into the goals of and in potentially coercive environment all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application it can no longer be considered legitimate professional exercise of anthropology in summary while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of anthropology within dod post world war ii developments before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology basic trends there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using variety of methods over more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia in the and calls for clarification of what constitutes culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals behaviors ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences by making comparisons across cultural traditions time based and cultural regions space based anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method central part of their science commonalities between fields because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises see history of anthropology including but not limited to fossil hunting exploring documentary film making paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time past societies and space non european non western societies for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author home it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus on the west in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists but this is increasingly changing starting in the from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded by marc augé le centre anthropologie des mondes contemporains the anthropological research center of contemporary societies since the it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to single locale there has also been related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories social movements governmental and

kimiya yi sa ādat the alchemy of happiness text on islamic philosophy and alchemy by the persian philosopher and mystic al ghazālī th century depiction of ouroboros from the alchemical treatise aurora consurgens th century zürich switzerland alchemy from arabic al kīmiyā is an ancient branch of natural philosophy philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout europe africa china and throughout asia observable in chinese text from around bce and greco roman egypt in the first few centuries ce alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain materials common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals lead into noble metals particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease and the development of an alkahest universal solvent the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and in the hellenistic and western mystery tradition the achievement of gnosis in europe the creation of philosopher stone was variously connected with all of these projects in english the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy but similar practices existed in the far east the indian subcontinent and the muslim world in europe following the th century renaissance produced by the translation of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy alchemists played significant role in early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine islamic and european alchemists developed structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today however they continued antiquity belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism their work was guided by hermetic principles related to magic mythology and religion modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms by scholars such as holmyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts despite this split which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions origin in mix of greek philosophy that was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as pseudo democritus first century on physical and mystical matters although alchemy is popularly associated with magic historian lawrence principe argues that recent historical research has revealed that medieval and early modern alchemy embraced much more diverse set of ideas goals techniques and practices most readers probably are aware of several common claims about alchemy for example that it is akin to magic or that its practice then or now is essentially deceptive these ideas about alchemy emerged during the eighteenth century or after while each of them might have limited validity within narrow context none of them is an accurate depiction of alchemy in general etymology the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie alkimie used in medieval latin as alchymia this name was itself brought from the arabic word al kīmiyā or composed of two parts the late greek term khēmeía χημεία also spelled khumeia χυμεία and khēmía χημία and the arabic definite article al meaning the together this association can be interpreted as the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis rd th centuries who derived it from the name of book the khemeu hermanm diels argued in that it rather derived from χύμα used to describe metallic objects formed by casting others trace its roots to the egyptian name kēme hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 khmi meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the nile valley as opposed to red desert sand according to the egyptologist wallis budge the arabic word al kīmiyaʾ actually means the egyptian science borrowing from the coptic word for egypt kēme or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic khēme this coptic word derives from demotic kmỉ itself from ancient egyptian kmt the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black egypt was the black land by contrast with the red land the surrounding desert so this etymology could also explain the nickname egyptian black arts history alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths in contrast western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions it is still an open question whether these three strands share common origin or to what extent they influenced each other hellenistic egypt zosimos from marcelin berthelot collection des anciens alchimistes grecs vol paris the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the greek and roman periods following the work of andré jean festugière modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmith art greek philosophy and different religious traditions tracing the origins of the alchemical art in egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the greek alchemical corpus the treatises of zosimos of panopolis the earliest historically attested author fl ce can however help in situating the other authors zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors such as mary the jewess pseudo democritus and agathodaimon but very little is known about any of these authors the most complete of their works the four books of pseudo democritus were probably written in the first century ad recent scholarship tend to emphasizes the testimony of zosimus who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices it has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in systematic way zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence also known as the final count zosimos explains that the ancient practice of tinctures the technical greek name for the alchemical arts had been taken over by certain demons who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices since zosimos also called the demons gardians of places οἱ κατὰ τόπον ἔφοροι and those who offered them sacrifices priests ἱερέα it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of egypt and their priests while critical of the kind alchemy he associated with the egyptian priests and their followers zosimos nonetheless saw the tradition recent past as rooted in the rites of the egyptian temples mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or thrice great hermes his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemy principal symbols according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge the hermetica of thrice great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to many writings were lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing revolt in alexandria few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus dating from they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or pseudo democritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into hermetic art philosophy alexandria acted as melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy character an important example of alchemy roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire according to aristotle each element had sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth st augustine later affirmed this in the th th centuries but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry examples of pagan christian and jewish alchemists can be found during this period most of the greco roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses isis cleopatra democritus and ostanes others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text after greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors by the middle of the th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the th and th centuries india the nd millennium bc text vedas describe connection between eternal life and gold considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in third century ce text called arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives agniyoga and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains yavakshara such as saltpetre nitre perfume making different qualities of perfumes are mentioned granulated refined sugar buddhist texts from the nd to th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold according to some scholars greek alchemy may have influenced indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim the th century persian chemist and physician abū rayhān bīrūnī who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of divine body sanskrit divya deham and immortality while still embodied sanskrit jīvan mukti sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess devī some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyāṇakārakam of ugrāditya written in south india in the early th century two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha nāgārjuna siddha was buddhist monk his book is an example of indian alchemy and medicine nityanātha siddha wrote rasaratnākara also highly influential work in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed method of converting mercury into gold scholarship on indian alchemy is in the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has been written by white the contents of sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in jan meulenbeld history of indian medical literature the discussion of these works in himl gives summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating chapter of himl various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra or various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of further six hundred and fifty five treatises in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy islamic world jabir ibn hayyan geber considered the father of chemistry introduced scientific and experimental approach to alchemy after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al kīmiyā الكيمياء the early islamic world was melting pot for alchemy platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late th and early th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship in the late th century jābir ibn hayyān latinized as geber or geberus introduced new approach to alchemy based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory in contrast to the ancient greek and egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible with very little concern for laboratory work jabir is thus considered by many to be the father of chemistry albeit others reserve that title for robert boyle or antoine lavoisier the science historian paul kraus wrote jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation early islamic chemists such as jabir ibn hayyan al kindi alkindus and muhammad ibn zakarīya al rāzi rasis or rhazes contributed number of key chemical discoveries such as the muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric and nitric acids and more the discovery that aqua regia mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir jabir ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosopher stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of substance name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element physical properties the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity the atomic theory of where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir from the th to th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus abū al rayhān al bīrūnī avicenna and ibn khaldun in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals east asia taoist alchemists often use this alternate version of the taijitu whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had more obvious connection to medicine the philosopher stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists as previously stated above chinese alchemy was more related to medicine it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find potion for eternal life described in th century texts and used in fireworks in china by the th century it was used in cannons by from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in and in europe by the th century chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering of the qi etc medieval europe the alchemist in search of the philosopher stone by joseph wright an illuminated page from book on alchemical processes and receipts ca th century the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to february with the completion of robert of chester translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy although european craftsmen and technicians pre existed robert notes in his preface that alchemy though here still referring to the elixir rather than to the art itself was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in th century toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and al razi these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought the th century st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in christian context in the early th century peter abelard followed anselm work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west in the early th century robert grosseteste used abelard methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking through much of the th and th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists in the th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms albertus magnus dominican friar is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals from the time shortly after his death through to the th century more than alchemical tracts were misattributed to him common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to albert student thomas aquinas roger bacon franciscan friar who wrote on wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work for as part of project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy connections to soteriology and christian theology bacon writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time the practical however confirmed the theoretical thought experiment and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine in later european legend however bacon became an archmage in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of brazen head capable of answering its owner questions soon after bacon the influential work of pseudo geber sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared his summa perfectionis remained staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described by the end of the th century alchemy had developed into fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam by purifying the two parts of man soul man could be reunited with god in the th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars pope john xxii edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists in henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and number were granted by henry vi and edward iv these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone the th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova nicolas flamel is well known alchemist but good example of pseudepigraphy the practice of giving your works the name of someone else usually more famous although the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in flamel was not religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher stone his work spends great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosopher stone through the th and th centuries alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art renaissance and early modern europe page from alchemic treatise of ramon llull th century the red sun rising over the city the final illustration of th century alchemical text splendor solis the word rubedo meaning redness was adopted by alchemists and signalled alchemical success and the end of the great work during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed in the late th century marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermeticism and alchemy he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim cast alchemy into new form rejecting some of agrippa occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyric synonym for alchemy from the greek words meaning to separate and to join together based on the latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus john dee july december followed agrippa occult tradition although better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth dee alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in was his most popular and influential work his writing portrayed alchemy as sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below during the th century short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswick lüneburg henry duke of brunswick lüneburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hesse kassel all contracted alchemists john son arthur dee worked as court physician to michael of russia and charles of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus alchemist sendivogius by jan matejko although most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance betrüger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic for example tycho brahe an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory research institute michael sendivogius michał sędziwój polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in lab sometime around sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in applied this in submarine isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newton occult studies than he did to either optics or physics other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science later modern period robert boyle an alchemist pictured in charles mackay extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its peak in the th century as late as james price claimed to have produced powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and anti aristotelian paracelsian and anti paracelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof robert boyle pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the th and th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton beginning around rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry by the alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than fraud in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the th century scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the th th and st centuries during the occult revival of the early th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the th century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as practical tradition or protoscience this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes in the th century revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy both forwarded completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy atwood work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists attempted to make case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about spiritual discipline under materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state in baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion in louis cattiaux published the message retrouvé work that was at once philosophical mystical and highly influenced by alchemy in his lineage many researchers including emmanuel and charles hooghvorst are updating alchemical studies in france and belgium women in alchemy several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy michael maier names mary the jewess cleopatra the alchemist medera and taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher stone zosimos sister theosebia later known as euthica the arab and isis the prophetess also played role in early alchemical texts the first alchemist whose name we know is said to have been mary the jewess early sources claim that mary or maria devised number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes the laboratory water bath known eponymously especially in france as the bain marie is said to have been invented or at least improved by her essentially double boiler it was and is used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating the tribikos modified distillation apparatus and the kerotakis more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her the occasional claim that mary was the first to discover hydrochloric acid is not accepted by most authorities although we have no writing from mary herself she is known from the early fourth century writings of zosimos of panopolis due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women after the greco roman period women names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel mary anne atwood suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery marks their return during the nineteenth century occult revival modern historical research the history of alchemy has become significant and recognized subject of academic study as the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism exeseso the european society for the study of western esotericism esswe and the university of amsterdam sub department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam recipe found in mid th century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold the author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society core concepts mandala illustrating common alchemical concepts symbols and processes from spiegel der kunst und natur western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosopher stone hermeticism in the eyes of variety of esoteric and hermetic practitioners alchemy is fundamentally spiritual transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection the writings attributed to hermes trismegistus are primary source of alchemical theory he is named alchemy founder and chief patron authority inspiration and guide early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis ad highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of religious regeneration of the human soul this approach continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were blind hiding their true spiritual philosophy practitioners and patrons such as melchior cibinensis and pope innocent viii existed within the ranks of the church while martin luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with christian teachings both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosopher stone then represented mystic key that would make this evolution possible applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal in texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning in his alchemical catechism théodore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic magnum opus the great work of alchemy is often described as series of four stages represented by colors nigredo blackening or melanosis albedo whitening or leucosis citrinitas yellowing or xanthosis rubedo reddening purpling or iosis modern alchemy due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the th century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence principe and william newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as george calian and anna marie roos who question the reading of principe and newman interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical movements groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as spiritual practice involving the self transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought traditional medicine traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances using pharmacological or combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques in ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in way that removes their toxicity these processes are actively used to the present day spagyrists of the th century albert richard riedel and jean dubuis merged paracelsian alchemy with occultism teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods the schools they founded les philosophes de la nature and the paracelsus research society popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products the courses books organizations and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as new age medicinal practice psychology alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images after being given copy of the translation of the secret of the golden flower chinese alchemical text by his friend richard wilhelm jung discovered direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner symbolic images coming up in dreams visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients process which he called process of individuation he regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this process of individuation of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal together with his alchemical mystica soror jungian swiss analyst marie louise von franz jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available compiled lexicon of key phrases with cross references and pored over them the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of and renewed alchemy popularity as symbolic process of coming into wholeness as human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage his writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces archetypes that influence all of life both von franz and jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is volume of his collected works mysterium coniunctionis literature alchemy has had long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to rowling and also the popular japanese manga fullmetal alchemist here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus in the th century chaucer began trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of terry pratchett visual artists had similar relationship with alchemy while some of them used alchemy as source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games modern science one goal of

the astronomer by johannes vermeer an astronomer is scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on specific question or field outside the scope of earth they observe astronomical objects such as stars planets moons comets and galaxies in either observational by analyzing the data or theoretical astronomy examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the universe as whole astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational and theoretical observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed because it takes millions to billions of years for system of stars or galaxy to complete life cycle astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die they use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology academic galileo is often referred to as the father of modern astronomy portrait by justus sustermans historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately members this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy the international astronomical union comprises almost members from different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond portrait of the flemish astronomer ferdinand verbiest who became head of the mathematical board and director of the observatory of the chinese emperor in contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use charge coupled device ccd camera to record long deep exposure allowing more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time before ccds photographic plates were common method of observation modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just few weeks per year analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as public service to encourage interest in the field those who become astronomers usually have broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable in college university most astronomers get phd in astronomy or physics amateur astronomers while there is relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on regular basis and often host star parties the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from different nations like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote few hours month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research see also list of astronomers list

ascii abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange is character encoding standard for electronic communication ascii codes represent text in computers equipment and other devices most modern character encoding schemes are based on ascii although they support many additional characters the internet assigned numbers authority iana prefers the name us ascii for this character encoding ascii is one of the ieee milestones overview ascii was developed from telegraph code its first commercial use was as seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services work on the ascii standard began on october with the first meeting of the american standards association asa now the american national standards institute or ansi subcommittee the first edition of the standard was published in underwent major revision during and experienced its most recent update during compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes specified characters into seven bit integers as shown by the ascii chart above ninety five of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits to lowercase letters to uppercase letters to and punctuation symbols in addition the original ascii specification included non printing control codes which originated with teletype machines most of these are now obsolete although few are still commonly used such as the carriage return line feed and tab codes for example lowercase would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary hexadecimal is the ninth letter decimal history control pictures of equivalent controls are shown where they exist or grey dot otherwise the american standard code for information interchange ascii was developed under the auspices of committee of the american standards association asa called the committee by its later subcommittee and later by that subcommittee working group now incits the asa became the united states of america standards institute usasi and ultimately the american national standards institute ansi with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa leaving code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet the indecision did not last long during may the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks and and international organization for standardization tc sc voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard the task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may meeting locating the lowercase letters in sticks and caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by single bit which simplified case insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers the committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar characters renaming some control characters som became start of header soh and moving or removing others ru was removed ascii was subsequently updated as usas then usas ansi and finally ansi revisions of the ascii standard asa asa approved but not published nevertheless used by ibm display stations and ibm display control usas usas ansi ansi ansi ansi ansi incits ansi incits ansi incits ansi incits in the standard the committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape they proposed track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats design considerations bit width the subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings ascii specifies correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols graphemes and control characters this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information such as written language before ascii was developed the encodings in use included alphabetic characters numerical digits and from to special graphic symbols to include all these and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet no ita standard of fieldata and early ebcdic more than codes were required for ascii ita were in turn based on the bit telegraph code émile baudot invented in and patented in the committee debated the possibility of shift function like in ita which would allow more than codes to be represented by six bit code in shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes long part of the transmission unreadable the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least seven bit code the committee considered an eight bit code since eight bits octets would allow two four bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice the committee voted to use seven bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for parity bit for error checking if desired eight bit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to in some printers the high bit was used to enable italics printing internal organization the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification the first two so called ascii sticks positions were reserved for control characters the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits the committee decided it was important to support uppercase character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to usable character set of graphic codes as was done in the dec sixbit code lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter was placed in position hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard the digits are prefixed with but the remaining bits correspond to their respective values in binary making conversion with binary coded decimal straightforward many of the non alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the remington no the first typewriter with shift key and the shifted values of were early typewriters omitted and using capital letter and lowercase letter instead but and pairs became standard once and became common thus in ascii were placed in the second stick positions corresponding to the digits in the adjacent stick the parentheses could not correspond to and however because the place corresponding to was taken by the space character this was accommodated by removing underscore from and shifting the remaining characters which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with and this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit paired keyboards notably the teletype model which used the left shifted layout corresponding to ascii not to traditional mechanical typewriters electric typewriters notably the ibm selectric used somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the ibm pc especially model and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did the pair also dates to the no and the pairs were used on some keyboards others including the no did not shift comma or full stop so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting however ascii split the pair dating to no and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly to some common characters were not included notably ½¼ while were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters in addition to common the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the french variation so the was placed in position hex right before the letter the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are you wru are you ru reserved device control dc synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns character order ascii code order is also called asciibetical order collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence the main deviations in ascii order are all uppercase come before lowercase letters for example precedes digits and many punctuation marks come before letters an intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values character groups control characters ascii reserves the first codes numbers decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ascii or to provide meta information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape for example character represents the line feed function which causes printer to advance its paper and character represents backspace refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non whitespace control characters except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within document other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where character would be used slightly differently on terminal link than on data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model asr which was printing terminal with an available paper tape reader punch option paper tape was very popular medium for long term program storage until the less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape in particular the teletype model machine assignments for codes control dc also known as xon control dc also known as xoff and delete became de facto standards the model was also notable for taking the description of control code bel meaning audibly alert the operator literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received bel character because the keytop for the key also showed left arrow symbol from ascii which had this character instead of underscore noncompliant use of code control shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected when teletype asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received control xoff an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to stop receiving control xon transmit on caused the tape reader to resume this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as handshaking signal warning sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow it persists to this day in many systems as manual output control technique on some systems control retains its meaning but control is replaced by second control to resume output the asr also could be configured to employ control dc and control dc to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively delete backspace the teletype could not move the head backwards so it did not put key on the keyboard to send bs backspace instead there was key marked that sent code del the purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in hand typed paper tape the operator had to push button on the tape punch to back it up then type the rubout which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with character that was intended to be ignored teletypes were commonly used for the less expensive computers from digital equipment corporation so these systems had to use the available key and thus the del code to erase the previous character because of this dec video terminals by default sent the del code for the key marked backspace while the key marked delete sent an escape sequence while many other terminals sent bs for the backspace key the unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character this could be set to bs or del but not both resulting in long period of annoyance where users had to correct it depending on what terminal they were using shells that allow line editing such as ksh bash and zsh understand both the assumption that no key sent bs caused control to be used for other purposes such as the help prefix command in gnu emacs escape many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones the escape character esc code for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings language strings and other systems where certain characters have reserved meaning over time this meaning has been co opted and has eventually been changed in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of command sequence usually in the form of so called ansi escape code or more properly control sequence introducer from ecma and its successors beginning with esc followed by left bracket character an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out of band character used to terminate an operation as in the teco and vi text editors in graphical user interface gui and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether end of line the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead the name carriage return comes from the fact that on manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line dec operating systems os rt rsx rsts tops etc used both characters to mark the end of line so that the console device originally teletype machines would work by the time so called glass ttys later called crts or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention when gary kildall created cp he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in dec rt until the introduction of pc dos in ibm had no hand in this because their operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless ibm pc dos also marketed as ms dos by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on cp and windows inherited it from ms dos unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as line terminator unix and unix like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return cr alone as line terminator however since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix based macos operating system they now use line feed lf as well the radio shack trs also used lone cr to terminate lines computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops and tenex using cr lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os that represented lines as character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different line ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting standard text format over the network telnet used ascii along with cr lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvt cr lf line ending convention end of file stream the pdp monitor and its pdp successor tops used control sub as an end of file indication for input from terminal some operating systems such as cp tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control to mark the end of the actual text in the file for these reasons eof or end of file was used colloquially and conventionally as three letter acronym for control instead of substitute the end of text code etx also known as control was inappropriate for variety of reasons while using as the control code to end file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as very convenient mnemonic aid historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt program via an input data stream usually from keyboard in library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such null terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here stands for zero control code chart binary oct dec hex abbreviation name null nul

commercially during as seven bit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraph twx teletypewriter exchange network twx originally used the earlier five bit ita which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemer ross code in europe because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii on march president lyndon johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce luther hodges regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december when utf encoding surpassed it utf is backward compatible with ascii variants and derivations as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve ascii character map in the bit range furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii bit codes from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdom pound sterling almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the us and few other countries for example canada had its own version that supported french characters many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non english letters currency symbols etc see also yuscii yugoslavia it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii and iso first acceptance of an international recommendation during caused ascii choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points iso iec like ascii is bit character set it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character code represented and in general text processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso iec german french or swedish etc programmer using their national variant of iso iec rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as aäiü ön instead of ai trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use many programmers kept their computers on us ascii so plain text in swedish german etc for example in mail or usenet contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to for example swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get jag har sm rg sar as the answer which should be nä jag har smörgåsar meaning no ve got sandwiches bit codes eventually as and bit and later bit computers began to replace and bit computers as the norm it became common to use an bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended bit relatives of ascii in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first bit characters encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard most early home computer systems developed their own bit character sets containing line drawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from to with more graphics kaypro cp computers used the upper characters for the greek alphabet the petscii code commodore international used for their bit systems is probably unique among post codes in being based on ascii instead of the more common ascii such as found on the zx spectrum computer atari bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants the ibm pc defined code page which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper positions operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set dec mcs for use in the popular vt terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets the iso iec standard derived from the dec mcs finally provided standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ascii but with many substitutions popular further extension designed by microsoft windows often mislabeled as iso added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing iso windows and the original bit ascii were the most common character encodings until when utf became more common iso iec introduced additional control codes defined in the hexadecimal range as part of extending the bit ascii encoding to become an bit system unicode unicode and the iso iec universal character set ucs have much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii is limited to characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural numbers called code points and encoding to or bit binary formats called utf utf and utf ascii was incorporated into the unicode character set as the first symbols so the bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets this allows utf to be backward compatible with bit ascii as utf file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support bit ascii extensions such as iso will preserve utf data unchanged see also ascii an asteroid named

animation is method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images in traditional animation images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film today most animations are made with computer generated imagery cgi computer animation can be very detailed animation while computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons low bandwidth or faster real time renderings other common animation methods apply stop motion technique to two and three dimensional objects like paper cutouts puppets or clay figures commonly the effect of animation is achieved by rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other the illusion as in motion pictures in general is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement but the exact causes are still uncertain analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope zoetrope flip book praxinoscope and film television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally for display on the computer techniques like animated gif and flash animation were developed animation is more pervasive than many people realize apart from short films feature films television series animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images animation is also prevalent in video games motion graphics user interfaces and visual effects the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics in for instance moving images in magic lantern shows can also be considered animation the mechanical manipulation of three dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has very long history in automata electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics animators are artists who specialize in creating animation etymology the word animation stems from the latin animātiōn stem of animātiō meaning bestowing of life the primary meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium history before cinematography nr in the reworked second series of stampfer stroboscopic discs published by trentsensky vieweg in hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation people from all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry automata shadow play and the magic lantern the multi media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in west european theatres from the late th century through the first half of the th century featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion projecting praxinoscope from here shown superimposing an animated figure on separately projected background scene in the stroboscopic disc better known as the phénakisticope introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with proper systematic breakdown of movements the stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope the flip book and the praxinoscope the average th century animation contained about images that were displayed as continuous loop by spinning device manually the flip book often contained more pictures and had beginning and end but its animation would not last longer than few seconds the first to create much longer sequences seems to have been charles émile reynaud who between and had much success with his to minute long pantomimes lumineuses silent era when cinematography eventually broke through in after animated pictures had been known for decades the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment animation on film was not commercialized until few years later by manufacturers of optical toys with film loops often traced from live action footage for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home it would take some more years before animation reached movie theatres after earlier experiments by movie pioneers stuart blackton arthur melbourne cooper segundo de chomón and edwin porter among others blackton the haunted hotel was the first huge stop motion success baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail without signs of any known stage trick fantasmagorie by émile cohl émile cohl fantasmagorie is the oldest known example of what became known as traditional hand drawn animation other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since and by winsor mccay with detailed drawn animation in films such as little nemo and gertie the dinosaur during the the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century felix the cat who debuted in became the first animated superstar golden age of us animation in steamboat willie featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disney studio at the forefront of the animation industry in disney also introduced the innovation of full colour in flowers and trees as part of three year long exclusive deal with technicolor the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the the united states dominated the world market of animation with plethora of cel animated theatrical shorts several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers including walt disney productions goofy and donald duck warner bros cartoons looney tunes characters like daffy duck bugs bunny tweety sylvester the cat wile coyote and road runner fleischer studios paramount cartoon studios betty boop popeye superman and casper mgm cartoon studio tom and jerry and droopy walter lantz productions universal studio cartoons woody woodpecker terrytoons th century fox mighty mouse and united artists pink panther animated features before cgi italian argentine cartoonist quirino cristiani showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character el peludo based on president yrigoyen patented in for the realization of his films including the world first animated feature film el apóstol in italian argentine director quirino cristiani made the first feature length film el apóstol now lost which became critical and commercial success it was followed by cristiani sin dejar rastros in but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government after working on it for three years lotte reiniger released the german feature length silhouette animation die abenteuer des prinzen achmed in the oldest extant animated feature in walt disney studios premiered their first animated feature snow white and the seven dwarfs still one of the highest grossing traditional animation features the fleischer studios followed this example in with gulliver travels with some success partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the second world war disney next features pinocchio fantasia both and fleischer studios second animated feature mr bug goes to town failed at the box office for decades afterwards disney would be the only american studio to regularly produce animated features until ralph bakshi became the first to also release more than handful features sullivan bluth studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with an american tail in although relatively few titles became as successful as disney features other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in wide variety of styles relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques russia soyuzmultfilm animation studio founded in produced films including shorts per year on average and reached titles in china czechoslovakia czech republic italy france and belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films while japan became true powerhouse of animation production with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation animation on television animation became very popular on television since the when television sets started to become common in most developed countries cartoons were mainly programmed for children on convenient time slots and especially us youth spent many hours watching saturday morning cartoons many classic cartoons found new life on the small screen and by the end of the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series hanna barbera productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series such as the flintstones the first prime time animated series scooby doo since and belgian co production the smurfs the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late and in the early with hit series such as the simpsons since as part of renaissance of american animation while us animated series also spawned successes internationally many other countries produced their own child oriented programming relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co productions with japanese studios resulting in hit series such as barbapapa the netherlands japan france wickie und die starken männer 小さなバイキング ビッケ vicky the viking austria germany japan and il était une fois once upon time france japan switch from cel animation to computer animation computer animation was gradually developed since the wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the with an early short appearance in the sci fi thriller futureworld the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without camera it was produced in style that very similar to traditional cel animation on the computer animation production system caps developed by the walt disney company in collaboration with pixar in the late the so called style more often associated with computer animation has become extremely popular since pixar toy story the first computer animated feature in this style most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the as it proved cheaper and more profitable not only the very popular animation style was generated with computers but also most of the films and series with more traditional hand crafted appearance in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects economic status in the animation market was worth us billion animated feature length films returned the highest gross margins around of all film genres between and animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early education propaganda and commercials the clarity of animation makes it powerful tool for instruction while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality it has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment during world war ii animation was widely exploited for propaganda many american studios including warner bros and disney lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values some countries including china japan and the united kingdom produced their first feature length animation for their war efforts animation has been very popular in television commercials both due to its graphic appeal and the humour it can provide some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades such as snap crackle and pop in advertisements for kellogg cereals the legendary animation director tex avery was the producer of the first raid kills bugs dead commercials in which were very successful for the company spin off enterprises other media merchandise and theme parks apart from their success in movie theaters and television series many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books while many comic book characters found their way to the screen which is often the case in japan where many manga are adapted into anime original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines somewhat similarly characters and plots for video games an interactive animation medium have been derived from films and vice versa some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media stories and images can easily be adapted into children books and other printed media songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example since first being licensed for children writing tablet in their mickey mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products as have many other disney characters this may have influenced some pejorative use of mickey name but licensed disney products sell well and the so called disneyana has many avid collectors and even dedicated disneyana fanclub since disneyland opened in and features many attractions that were based on disney cartoon characters its enormous success spawned several other disney theme parks and resorts disney earnings from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies criticism criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception with its popularity large amount of criticism has arisen especially animated feature length films many concerns of cultural representation psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture awards as with any other form of media animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year during the th academy awards function the first winner of the academy award was the short flowers and trees production by walt disney productions the academy award for feature length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year and awarded during the th academy awards in it was won by the film shrek produced by dreamworks and pacific data images disney animation and pixar has produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture up and toy story also received best picture nominations after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten academy award for best animated feature academy award for best animated short film several other countries have instituted an award for the best animated feature film as part of their national film awards africa movie academy award for best animation since bafta award for best animated film since césar award for best animated film since golden rooster award for best animation since goya award for best animated film since japan academy prize for animation of the year since national film award for best animated film since also since the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards since the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film the annie award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation unlike the academy awards the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavour they were re organized in to create new field for best animated feature the winners were dominated by walt disney however newer studios led by pixar dreamworks have now begun to consistently vie for this award the list of awardees is as follows annie award for best animated feature annie award for best animated short subject annie award for best animated television production production joy heron featured video the creation of non trivial animation works longer than few seconds has developed as form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects traits common to both live action and animated feature length films are labor intensity and high production costs the most important difference is that once film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live action films it is relatively easy for director to ask for one more take during principal photography of live action film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation it is pointless for studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating visually dazzling five minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as whole while live action films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards real time improvisation another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain film consistency from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger animators like all artists necessarily have individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in consistent way to whatever style is employed on particular film since the early teams of about to people of whom to are animators typically have created feature length animated films it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult this problem is usually solved by having separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles unlike live action films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film in the early animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late techniques traditional animation an example of traditional animation horse animated by rotoscoping from eadweard muybridge th century photos traditional animation also called cel animation or hand drawn animation was the process used for most animated films of the th century the individual frames of traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings the completed character cels are photographed one by one against painted background by rostrum camera onto motion picture film the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the st century today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into computer system various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional mm film and newer media with digital video the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past years some animation producers have used the term tradigital play on the words traditional and digital to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states animal farm united kingdom lucky and zorba italy and the illusionist british french traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king us the prince of egypt us akira japan spirited away japan the triplets of belleville france and the secret of kells irish french belgian full animation full animation refers to the process of producing high quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having smooth animation fully animated films can be made in variety of styles from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney studio the little mermaid beauty and the beast aladdin the lion king to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros animation studio many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are non disney works the secret of nimh us the iron giant us and nocturna spain fully animated films are animated at frames per second with combination of animation on ones and twos meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of or two frames out of limited animation limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually choppy or skippy movement animation limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation this is more economic technique pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald mcboing boing us yellow submarine uk and certain anime produced in japan its primary use however has been in producing cost effective animated content for media for television the work of hanna barbera filmation and other tv animation studios and later the internet web cartoons rotoscoping rotoscoping is technique patented by max fleischer in where animators trace live action movement frame by frame the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings us or used in stylized and expressive manner as in waking life us and scanner darkly us some other examples are fire and ice us heavy metal and aku no hana live action animation live action animation is technique combining hand drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over live action footage walt disney and ub iwerks created series of alice comedies in which live action girl enters an animated world other examples include allegro non troppo italy who framed roger rabbit us volere volare italy space jam us and osmosis jones us stop motion animation stop motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real world objects and photographing them one frame of film at time to create the illusion of movement there are many different types of stop motion animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation computer software is widely available to create this type of animation traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time consuming to produce than current computer animation puppet animation typically involves stop motion puppet figures interacting in constructed environment in contrast to real world interaction in model animation the puppets generally have an armature inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints examples include the tale of the fox france the nightmare before christmas us corpse bride us coraline us the films of jiří trnka and the adult animated sketch comedy television series robot chicken us present puppetoon created using techniques developed by george pal are puppet animated films that typically use different version of puppet for different frames rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet finnish television commercial clay animation or plasticine animation often called claymation which however is trademarked name uses figures made of clay or similar malleable material to create stop motion animation the figures may have an armature or wire frame inside similar to the related puppet animation below that can be manipulated to pose the figures alternatively the figures may be made entirely of clay in the films of bruce bickford where clay creatures morph into variety of different shapes examples of clay animated works include the gumby show us mio mao italy morph shorts uk wallace and gromit shorts uk as of jan švankmajer dimensions of dialogue czechoslovakia the trap door uk films include wallace gromit the curse of the were rabbit chicken run and the adventures of mark twain strata cut animation strata cut animation is most commonly form of clay animation in which long bread like loaf of clay internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery is sliced into thin sheets with the animation camera taking frame of the end of the loaf for each cut eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within cutout animation is type of stop motion animation produced by moving two dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth examples include terry gilliam animated sequences from monty python flying circus uk fantastic planet france czechoslovakia tale of tales russia the pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series and sometimes in episodes of south park us and the music video live for the moment from verona riots band produced by alberto serrano and nívola uyá spain silhouette animation is variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes examples include the adventures of prince achmed weimar republic and princes et princesses france model animation refers to stop motion animation created to interact with and exist as part of live action world intercutting matte effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop motion characters or objects with live actors and settings examples include the work of ray harryhausen as seen in films jason and the argonauts and the work of willis brien on films king kong go motion is variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film which is not present in traditional stop motion the technique was invented by industrial light magic and phil tippett to create special effect scenes for the film the empire strikes back another example is the dragon named vermithrax from film dragonslayer object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop motion animation as opposed to specially created items graphic animation uses non drawn flat visual graphic material photographs newspaper clippings magazines etc which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement at other times the graphics remain stationary while the stop motion camera is moved to create on screen action brickfilm are subgenre of object animation involving using lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation these have had recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites youtube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters this allows for number of surreal effects including disappearances and reappearances allowing people to appear to slide across the ground and other effects examples of pixilation include the secret adventures of tom thumb and angry kid shorts and the academy award winning neighbours by norman mclaren computer animation computer animation encompasses variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on computer animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact animation can create images that seem real to the viewer animation animation of two circles joined by chain animation figures are created or edited on the computer using bitmap graphics and vector graphics this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping animation has many applications including analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated final line advection animation is technique used in animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm animation animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator the animator usually starts by creating polygon mesh to manipulate mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to object or environment sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement other techniques can be applied mathematical functions gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects fire and water simulations these techniques fall under the category of dynamics terms cel shaded animation is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software shading looks stark with less blending of colors examples include skyland france the iron giant united states futurama fox appleseed ex machina japan the legend of zelda the wind waker japan the legend of zelda breath of the wild japan machinima films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds the term originated from the software introduction in the demoscene as well as the recordings of the first person shooter video game quake motion capture is used when live action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into cg characters examples include polar express us beowulf us christmas carol us the adventures of tintin us kochadiiyan india computer animation is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin plants water fire clouds etc examples include up us how to train your dragon us physically based animation is animation using computer simulations mechanical animation animatronics is the use of mechatronics to create machines that seem animate rather than robotic audio animatronics and autonomatronics is form of robotics animation combined with animation created by walt disney imagineering for shows and attractions at disney theme parks move and make noise generally recorded speech or song they are fixed to whatever supports them they can sit and stand and they cannot walk an audio animatron is different from an android type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds rather than responding to external stimuli in disney created an interactive version of the technology called autonomatronics linear animation generator is form of animation by using static picture frames installed in tunnel or shaft the animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in linear motion parallel to the installed picture frames the concept and the technical solution were invented in by mihai girlovan in romania chuckimation is type of animation created by the makers of the television series action league now in which characters props are thrown or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands the magic lantern used mechanical slides to project moving images probably since christiaan huygens invented this early image projector in other animation styles techniques and approaches world of color hydrotechnics at disney california adventure creates illusion of motion using fountains with high definition projections on mist screens hydrotechnics technique that includes lights water fire fog and lasers with high definition projections on mist screens drawn on film animation technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on film stock for example by norman mclaren len lye and stan brakhage paint on glass animation technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying oil paints on sheets of glass for example by aleksandr petrov erasure animation technique using traditional media photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image for example william kentridge is famous for his charcoal erasure films and piotr dumała for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster pinscreen animation makes use of screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen the screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows the technique has been used to create animated films with range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation sand animation sand is moved around on back or front lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film this creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light contrast flip book flip book sometimes especially in british english called flick book is book with series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next so that when the pages are turned rapidly the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change flip books are often illustrated books for children they also be geared towards adults and employ series of photographs rather than drawings flip books are not always separate books they appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines often in the page corners software packages and websites are also available that

apollo is one of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology the national divinity of the greeks apollo has been recognized as god of archery music and dance truth and prophecy healing and diseases the sun and light poetry and more one of the most important and complex of the greek gods he is the son of zeus and leto and the twin brother of artemis goddess of the hunt seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros ephebe or beardless athletic youth apollo is considered to be the most greek of all the gods apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu as the patron deity of delphi apollo pythios apollo is an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil various epithets call him the averter of evil delphic apollo is the patron of seafarers foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius apollo delivered people from epidemics yet he is also god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows the invention of archery itself is credited to apollo and his sister artemis apollo is usually described as carrying golden bow and quiver of silver arrows apollo capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona as the protector of young kourotrophos apollo is concerned with the health and education of children he presided over their passage into adulthood long hair which was the prerogative of boys was cut at the coming of age ephebeia and dedicated to apollo apollo is an important pastoral deity and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds protection of herds flocks and crops from diseases pests and predators were his primary duties on the other hand apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution he is associated with dominion over colonists he was the giver of laws and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in city as the god of mousike art of muses apollo presides over all music songs dance and poetry he is the inventor of string music and the frequent companion of the muses functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations the lyre is common attribute of apollo in hellenistic times especially during the th century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios the personification of the sun in latin texts however there was no conflation of apollo with sol among the classical latin poets until st century ce apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the th century ce etymology apollo seated with lyre porphyry and marble nd century ad farnese collection naples italy alt px apollo attic ionic and homeric greek apollōn doric apellōn arcadocypriot apeilōn aeolic aploun the name apollo unlike the related older name paean is generally not found in the linear mycenean greek texts although there is possible attestation in the lacunose form pe rjo linear on the kn tablet the etymology of the name is uncertain the spelling in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form apellon is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier it probably is cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the family festival apellai according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the ecclesia beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested pre greek proto form apalyun several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors thus the greeks most often associated apollo name with the greek verb apollymi to destroy plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redemption with apolousis purification and with haploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word pella the capital of ancient macedonia and pellēnē pallene number of non greek etymologies have been suggested for the name the hittite form apaliunas is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter perhaps related to hurrian and certainly the etruscan aplu god of plague in turn likely from akkadian aplu enlil meaning simply the son of enlil title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending plague against the greeks the reasoning behind god of the plague becoming god of healing is apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric the name of the lydian god qλdãns kʷʎðãns may reflect an earlier kʷalyán before palatalization syncope and the pre lydian sound change note the labiovelar in place of the labial found in pre doric ἀπέλjων and hittite apaliunas luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter greco roman epithets apollo chief epithet was phoebus phoibos literally bright it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollo role as the god of light like other greek deities he had number of others applied to him reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to

old anatolian god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people healer and god protector from evil the function of apollo as healer is connected with paean the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from more primitive religion paeοn is probably connected with the mycenaean pa ja wo ne linear but this is not certain he did not have separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magic song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean the magicians were also called seer doctors and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra he sends plague to the achaeans the god who sends disease can also prevent it therefore when it stops they make purifying ceremony and offer him hecatomb to ward off evil when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with song they call their own god the paean some common epithets of apollo as healer are paion literally healer or helper epikourios succouring oulios healer baleful and loimios of the plague in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios averting evil and alexikakos keeping off ill from in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as god of healing homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollo son asclepius the healer about the th century bce the paean became merely formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music apollo role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when fleet left the harbour and also after victory had been won dorian origin apollo victorious over the python by the florentine pietro francavilla dated depicting apollo first triumph when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent python which lies dead at his feet the walters art museum the connection with the dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars the family festival was dedicated to apollo doric apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros the great kouros however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos the homeric hymn represents apollo as northern intruder his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated female dragon named delphyne cf womb and male serpent typhon from to smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python python was the good daemon ἀγαθὸς δαίμων of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology in greek mythology artemis was the leader hegemon of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves the elf shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting stone arrow heads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiva is healer physician god however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult minoan origin minoan labrys it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean age in historical times the priests of delphi were called lab yadai the double axe men which indicates minoan origin the double axe labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices apollo delphinios or delphidios was sea god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands apollo sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the master of the animals male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute his original name is unknown but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo who stood by the virgin mistress of the animals becoming her brother the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that kind of inspiration prophecy existed in the temple this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel leaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania frenzy greek word he connected with mantis prophet frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc although crete had contacts with mari from bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece anatolian origin illustration of coin of apollo agyieus from ambracia non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollo mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylonian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites in hittite text is mentioned that the king invited babylonian priestess for certain purification similar story is mentioned by plutarch he writes that the cretan seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seer expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had resisting religion up to historical times it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war he is pictured as terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods the god seems to be related to appaliunas tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo western anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of artimus artemis and qλdãns whose name may be cognate with the hittite and doric forms in surviving lydian texts however recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of qλdãns with apollo the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was tapered stone or column however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates babylonian origin the late bronze age from to bce hittite and hurrian aplu was god of plague invoked during plague years here we have an apotropaic situation where god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it aplu meaning the son of was title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash homer interprets apollo as terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing magic art that separates him from the other greek gods in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo oracular cult temple of apollo at delphi greece oracular tripod unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality lycia was sacred to the god for this apollo was also called lycian apollo cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about bce apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites in the nd and rd century ce those at didyma and claros pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity in the rd century apollo fell silent julian the apostate tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed oracular shrines delos lions apollo had famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in claros and didyma his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus his oracular shrines include abae in phocis bassae in the peloponnese at clarus on the west coast of asia minor as at delphi holy spring which gave off pneuma from which the priests drank in corinth the oracle of corinth came from the town of tenea from prisoners supposedly taken in the trojan war at khyrse in troad the temple was built for apollo smintheus in delos there was an oracle to the delian apollo during summer the hieron sanctuary of apollo adjacent to the sacred lake was the place where the god was said to have been born in delphi the pythia became filled with the pneuma of apollo said to come from spring inside the adyton in didyma an oracle on the coast of anatolia south west of lydian luwian sardis in which priests from the lineage of the branchidae received inspiration by drinking from healing spring located in the temple was believed to have been founded by branchus son or lover of apollo in hierapolis bambyce syria modern manbij according to the treatise de dea syria the sanctuary of the syrian goddess contained robed and bearded image of apollo divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image at patara in lycia there was seasonal winter oracle of apollo said to have been the place where the god went from delos as at delphi the oracle at patara was woman in segesta in sicily oracles were also given by sons of apollo in oropus north of athens the oracle amphiaraus was said to be the son of apollo oropus also had sacred spring in labadea east of delphi trophonius another son of apollo killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle temples of apollo many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics the doric order dominated during the th and the th century bc but there was mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldn be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome the most important temples are greek temples thebes greece the oldest temple probably dedicated to apollo ismenius was built in the th century it seems that it was curvilinear building the doric temple was built in the early th century but only some small parts have been found festival called daphnephoria was celebrated every ninth year in honour of apollo ismenius or galaxius the people held laurel branches daphnai and at the head of the procession walked youth chosen priest of apollo who was called daphnephoros eretria according to the homeric hymn to apollo the god arrived to the plain seeking for location to establish its oracle the first temple of apollo daphnephoros apollo laurel bearer or carrying off daphne is dated to the temple was curvilinear hecatombedon hundred feet in smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building another temple probably peripteral was built in the th century with an inner row of wooden columns over its geometric predecessor it was rebuilt peripteral around with the stylobate

of apollo clarius was probably built in the rd century and it was peripteral with columns it was reconstructed at the end of the hellenistic period and later from the emperor hadrian but pausanias claims that it was still incomplete in the nd century hamaxitus troad in iliad chryses the priest of apollo addresses the god with the epithet smintheus lord of mice related with the god ancient role

temple of apollo was built probably in the th rd century parts of teraccotta capital and teraccotta base have been found it seems that the etruscan columns were derived from the archaic doric cult of apollo soranus is attested by one inscription found near falerii plan of the temple of apollo pompeii pompeii italy the cult of apollo was widespread in the region of campania since the th century the temple was built in but its beginnings lie in the th century it was reconstructed after an earthquake in it demonstrates mixing of styles which formed the basis of roman architecture the columns in front of the cella formed tuscan prostyle porch and the cella is situated unusually far back the peripteral colonnade of ionic columns was placed in such way that the emphasis was given to the front side rome the temple of apollo sosianus and the temple of apollo medicus the first temple building dates to and was dedicated to apollo medicus the doctor after plague of it was rebuilt by gaius sosius probably in only three columns with corinthian capitals exist today it seems that the cult of apollo had existed in this area since at least to the mid th century rome the temple of apollo palatinus was located on the palatine hill within the sacred boundary of the city it was dedicated by augustus on the façade of the original temple was ionic and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble many famous statues by greek masters were on display in and around the temple including marble statue of the god at the entrance and statue of apollo in the cella melite modern mdina malta temple of apollo was built in the city in the nd century its remains were discovered in the th century and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures parts of the temple podium were rediscovered in mythology apollo appears often in the myths plays and hymns as zeus favorite son apollo had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans divinity beyond human comprehension he appears both as beneficial and wrathful god birth leto with her children by william henry rinehart apollo was the son of zeus the king of the gods and leto his previous wife or one of his mistresses growing up apollo was nursed by the nymphs korythalia and aletheia the personification of truth when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma leto sought shelter in many lands only to be rejected by them finally the voice of unborn apollo informed his mother about floating island named delos which had once been asteria leto own sister since it was neither mainland nor an island leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under palm tree all the goddesses except hera were present to witness the event it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her necklace of amber yards or meters long leto holding apollo by lazar widmann when apollo was born clutching golden sword everything on delos turned into gold and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight he was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in white garment and fastened golden bands around him since leto was unable to feed the him themis the goddess of divine law fed him with nectar or ambrosia upon tasting the divine food apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery and interpret the will of zeus to humankind zeus who had calmed hera by the time came and adorned his son with golden headband leto with apollo and artemis by francesco pozzi apollo birth fixed the floating delos to the earth leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the delians according to some apollo secured delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time this island became sacred to apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god apollo was born on the seventh day hebdomagenes of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him mythographers agree that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo or that artemis was born on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo hyperborea hyperborea the mystical land of eternal spring venerated apollo above all the gods the hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted pythian games there vast forest of beautiful trees was called the garden of apollo apollo spent the winter months among the hyperboreans his absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death no prophecies were issued during this time he returned to the world during the beginning of the spring the theophania festival was held in delphi to celebrate his return it is said that leto came to delos from hyperborea accompanied by pack of wolves henceforth hyperborea became apollo winter home and wolves became sacred to him his intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet lyceus meaning wolf like but apollo was also the wolf slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators the hyperborean worship of apollo bears the strongest marks of apollo being worshipped as the sun god shamanistic elements in apollo cult are often liked to his hyperborean origin and he is likewise speculated to have originated as solar shaman shamans like abaris and aristeas were also the followers of apollo who hailed from hyperborea in myths the tears of amber apollo shed when his son asclepius died became the waters of the river eridanos which surrounded hyperborea apollo also buried in hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the cyclopes he later gave this arrow to abaris childhood and youth as child apollo is said to have built foundation and an altar on delos using the horns of the goats that his sister artemis hunted since he learnt the art of building when young he later came to be known as archegetes the founder of towns and god who guided men to build new cities from his father zeus apollo had also received golden chariot drawn by swans phoebe gifts the oracular tripod to apollo by john flaxman in his early years when apollo spent his time herding cows he was reared by thriae the bee nymphs who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills apollo is also said to have invented the lyre and along with artemis the art of archery he then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery phoebe his grandmother gave the oracular shrine of delphi to apollo as birthday gift themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of delphi thereon python python pursuing leto and her children engravings on wood python chthonic serpent dragon was child of gaea and the guardian of the delphic oracle whose death was foretold by apollo when he was still in leto womb python was the nurse of the giant typhon in most of the traditions apollo was still child when he killed python python was sent by hera to hunt the pregnant leto to death and had assaulted her to avenge the trouble given to his mother apollo went in search of python and killed it in the sacred cave at delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from hephaestus the delphian nymphs who were present encouraged apollo during the battle with the cry hie paean after apollo was victorious they also brought him gifts and gave the corycian cave to him according to homer apollo had encountered and killed the python when he was looking for place to establish his shrine according to another version when leto was in delphi python had attacked her apollo defended his mother and killed python euripides in his iphigenia in aulis gives an account of his fight with python and the events aftermath you killed him phoebus while still baby still leaping in the arms of your dear mother and you entered the holy shrine and sat on the golden tripod on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals detailed account of apollo conflict with gaea and zeus intervention on behalf of his young son is also given but when apollo came and sent themis the child of earth away from the holy oracle of pytho earth gave birth to dream visions of the night and they told to the cities of men the present and what will happen in the future through dark beds of sleep on the ground and so earth took the office of prophecy away from phoebus in envy because of her daughter the lord made his swift way to olympus and wound his baby hands around zeus asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the pythian home zeus smiled that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold he shook his locks of hair put an end to the night voices and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness and gave the privilege back again to loxias apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his wish that zeus granted him readily because of this athena who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles cast her pebbles away in displeasure apollo killing the python by hendrik goltzius however apollo had committed blood murder and had to be purified because python was child of gaea gaea wanted apollo to be banished to tartarus as punishment zeus didn agree and instead exiled his son from olympus and instructed him to get purified apollo had to serve as slave for nine years after the servitude was over as per his father order he travelled to the vale of tempe to bath in waters of peneus there zeus himself performed purificatory rites on apollo purified apollo was escorted by his half sister athena to delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by gaea according to variation apollo had also travelled to crete where carmanor purified him apollo later established the pythian games to appropriate gaea henceforth apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and made men aware of their guilt and purified them soon after zeus instructed apollo to go to delphi and establish his law but apollo disobeying his father went to the land of hyperborea and stayed there for year he returned only after the delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back zeus pleased with his son integrity gave apollo the seat next to him on his right side he also gave to apollo various gifts like golden tripod golden bow and arrows golden chariot and the city of delphi apollo victorious over the python by françois gaspard adam soon after his return apollo needed to recruit people to delphi so when he spotted ship sailing from crete he sprang aboard in the form of dolphin the crew was awed into submission and followed course that led the ship to delphi there apollo revealed himself as god initiating them to his service he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts the pythia was apollo high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies pythia is arguably the constant favorite of apollo among the mortals tityos apollo slaying tityos attic red figure kylix bc hera once again sent another giant tityos to rape leto this time apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword according to other version artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking tityos with her arrows after the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver admetus apollo guards the herds or flocks of king admetus by felice gianni admetus was the king of pherae who was known for his hospitality when apollo was exiled from olympus for killing python he served as herdsman under admetus who was then young and unmarried apollo is said to have shared romantic relationship with admetus during his stay after completing his years of servitude apollo went back to olympus as god because admetus had treated apollo well the god conferred great benefits on him in return apollo mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins apollo helped admetus win the hand of alcestis the daughter of king pelias by taming lion and boar to draw admetus chariot he was present during their wedding to give his blessings when admetus angered the goddess artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister when apollo learnt of admetus untimely death he convinced or tricked the fates into letting admetus live past his time according to another version or perhaps some years later when zeus struck down apollo son asclepius with lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus for this but his mother leto intervened and reminding zeus of their old love pleaded him not to kill their son zeus obliged and sentenced apollo to one year of hard labor once again under admetus the love between apollo and admetus was favored topic of roman poets like ovid and servius niobe niobe children are killed by apollo and diana by pierre charles jombert the fate of niobe was prophesied by apollo while he was still in leto womb niobe was the queen of thebes and wife of amphion she displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two she further mocked apollo effeminate appearance and artemis manly appearance leto insulted by this told her children to punish niobe accordingly apollo killed niobe sons and artemis her daughters according to some versions of the myth among the niobids chloris and her brother amyclas were not killed because they prayed to leto amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them when chloris married and had children apollo granted her son nestor the years he had taken away from the niobids hence nestor was able to live for generations building the walls of troy once apollo and poseidon served under the trojan king laomedon in accordance to zeus words apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris apollo guarded the cattle of laomedon in the valleys of mount ida while poseidon built the walls of troy other versions make both apollo and poseidon the builders of the wall in ovid account apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre in pindar odes the gods took mortal named aeacus as their assistant when the work was completed three snakes rushed against the wall and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by aeacus apollo immediately prophesied that troy would fall at the hands of aeacus descendants the aeacidae his son telamon joined heracles when he sieged the city during laomedon rule later his great grandson neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of troy laomedon refusing payment to poseidon and apollo by joachim von sandrart however the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised but also threatened to bind their feet and hands and sell them as slaves angered by the unpaid labour and the insults apollo infected the city with pestilence and posedion sent the sea monster cetus to deliver the city from it laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter hesione who would later be saved by heracles during his stay in troy apollo had lover named ourea who was nymph and daughter of poseidon together they had son named ileus whom apollo loved dearly trojan war apollo sided with the trojans during the trojan war waged by the greeks against the trojans during the war the greek king agamemnon captured chryseis the daughter of apollo priest chryses and refused to return her angered by this apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment he demanded that they return the girl and the achaeans greeks complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad apollo preceding hector with his aegis and dispersing the greeks by john flaxman receiving the aegis from zeus apollo entered the battlefield as per his father command causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry he pushed the greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers he is described as the rouser of armies because he rallied the trojan army when they were falling apart when zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war apollo was provoked by poseidon to duel however apollo declined to fight him saying that he wouldn fight his uncle for the sake of mortals apollo prevents diomedes from pursuing aeneas when the greek hero diomedes injured the trojan hero aeneas aphrodite tried to rescue him but diomedes injured her as well apollo then enveloped aeneas in cloud to protect him he repelled the attacks diomedes made on him and gave the hero stern warning to abstain himself from attacking god aeneas was then taken to pergamos sacred spot in troy where he was healed after the death of sarpedon son of zeus apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father wish and cleaned it he then gave it to sleep hypnos and death thanatos apollo had also once convinced athena to stop the war for that day so that the warriors can relieve themselves for while apollo protecting hector body by john flaxman the trojan hero hector who according to some was the god own son by hecuba was favored by apollo when he got severely injured apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms during duel with achilles when hector was about to lose apollo hid hector in cloud of mist to save him when the greek warrior patroclus tried to get into the fort of troy he was stopped by apollo encouraging hector to attack patroclus apollo stripped the armour of the greek warrior and broke his weapons patroclus was eventually killed by hector at last after hector fated death apollo protected his corpse from achilles attempt to mutilate it by creating magical cloud over the corpse achilles slaying troilus apollo held grudge against achilles throughout the war because achilles had murdered his son tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son troilus in his own temple not only did apollo save hector from achilles he also tricked achilles by disguising himself as trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates he foiled achilles attempt to mutilate hector dead body finally apollo caused achilles death by guiding an arrow shot by paris into achilles heel in some versions apollo himself killed achilles by taking the disguise of paris apollo helped many trojan warriors including agenor polydamas glaucus in the battlefield though he greatly favored the trojans apollo was bound to follow the orders of zeus and served his father loyally during the war heracles after heracles then named alcides was struck with madness and killed his family he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of apollo apollo through the pythia commanded him to serve king eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him only then would alcides be absolved of his sin apollo also renamed him as heracles heracles and apollo struggling over the hind as depicted on corinthian helmet early th century bc to complete his third task heracles had to capture the ceryneian hind hind sacred to artemis and bring it alive he chased the hind for one year when the animal eventually got tired and tried crossing the river ladon he captured it while he was taking it back he was confronted by apollo and artemis who were angered at heracles for this act however heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her after much pleading artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later heracles steals apollo tripod attic black figure oinochoe ca bc after he was freed from his servitude to eurystheus heracles fell in conflict with iphytus prince of oechalia and murdered him soon after he contracted terrible disease he consulted the oracle of apollo once again in hope of ridding himself of the disease the pythia however denied to give any prophesy in anger heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away intending to start his own oracle however apollo did not tolerate this and stopped heracles duel ensued between them artemis rushed to support apollo while athena supported heracles soon zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them he reprimanded heracles for this act of violation and asked apollo to give solution to heracles apollo then ordered the hero to serve under omphale queen of lydia for one year in order to purify himself periphas periphas was an attican king and priest of apollo he was noble just and rich he did all his duties justly because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as zeus at one point they worshipped periphas in place of zeus and set up shrines and temples for him this annoyed zeus who decided to annihilate the entire family of periphas but because he was just king and good devotee apollo intervened and requested his father to spare periphas zeus considered apollo words and agreed to let him live but he metamorphosed periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds when periphas wife requested zeus to let her stay with her husband zeus turned her into vulture and fulfilled her wish plato concept of soulmates long time ago there were three kinds of human beings male descended from the sun female descended from the earth and androgynous descended from the moon each human being was completely round with four arms and fours legs two identical faces on opposite sides of head with four ears and all else to match they were powerful and unruly otis and ephialtes even dared to scale mount olympus to check their insolence zeus devised plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them he cut them all in two and asked apollo to make necessary repairs giving humans the individual shape they still have now apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds he pulled together their skin at the abdomen and sewed the skin together at the middle of it this is what we call navel today he smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest but he made sure to leave few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment as he zeus cut them one after another he bade apollo give the face and the half of the neck turn apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms so apollo gave turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly like the purses which draw in and he made one mouth at the centre of the belly which he fastened in knot the same which is called the navel he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles much as shoemaker might smooth leather upon last he left few wrinkles however in the region of the belly and navel as memorial of the primeval state nurturer of the young apollo kourotrophos is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young especially boys he oversees their education and their passage into adulthood education is said to have originated from apollo and the muses many myths have him train his children it was custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to apollo after reaching adulthood chiron the abandoned centaur was fostered by apollo who instructed him in medicine prophecy archery and more chiron would later become great teacher

princess stratonice to be his son bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed apollo saved shepherd boy name unknown from death in large deep cave by the means of vultures to thank him the shepherd built apollo temple under the name vulturius god of music immediately after his birth apollo demanded lyre and invented the paean thus becoming the god of music as the divine singer he is the patron of poets singers and musicians the invention of string music is attributed to him plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music rhythm and harmony is the gift of apollo and the muses according to socrates ancient greeks believed that apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together both for the gods and the humans for this reason he was called homopolon before the homo was replaced by apollo harmonious music delivered people from their pain and hence like dionysus he is also called the liberator the swans which were considered to be the most musical among the birds were believed to be the singers of apollo they are apollo sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to hyperborea aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to apollo the swans would join the chant in unison among the pythagoreans the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of apollo their principal deity their belief was that the music purifies the soul just as medicine purifies the body they also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres the music of the spheres shown in this engraving from renaissance italy are apollo the muses the planetary spheres and musical ratios apollo appears as the companion of the muses and as musagetes leader of muses he leads them in dance they spend their time on parnassus which is one of their sacred places apollo is also the lover of the muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like orpheus and linus apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre in his role as the god of banquets he was always present to play music in weddings of the gods like the marriage of eros and psyche peleus and thetis he is frequent guest of the bacchanalia and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others he was the victor in all those contests but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris apollo and the muses on parnassus by andrea appiani apollo lyre the invention of lyre is attributed either to hermes or to apollo himself distinctions have been made that hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell whereas the lyre apollo invented was regular lyre myths tell that the infant hermes stole number of apollo cows and took them to cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cow intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre the friendship of apollo and hermes by noël coypel upon discovering the theft apollo confronted hermes and asked him to return his cattle when hermes acted innocent apollo took the matter to zeus zeus having seen the events sided with apollo and ordered hermes to return the cattle hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre hence apollo then became the master of the lyre detail of apollo lyre according to other versions apollo had invented the lyre himself whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to marsyas hermes lyre therefore would be reinvention contest with pan the musical duel of pan and apollo by laurits tuxen once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge the god of music to contest the mountain god tmolus was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre it was so beautiful that tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and everyone was pleased with the judgement only midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo did not want to suffer such depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of donkey contest with marsyas marsyas was satyr who was punished by apollo for his hubris he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy athena had also placed curse upon the instrument that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished when marsyas played the flute everyone became frenzied with joy this led marsyas to think that he was better than apollo and he challenged the god to musical contest the contest was judged by the muses or the nymphs of nysa athena was also present to witness the contest athena and marsyas marsyas taunted apollo for wearing his hair long for having fair face and smooth body for his skill in so many arts he also further said his apollo hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face his body is fair from head to foot his limbs shine bright his tongue gives oracles and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse propose which you will what of his robes so fine in texture so soft to the touch aglow with purple what of his lyre that flashes gold gleams white with ivory and shimmers with rainbow gems what of his song so cunning and so sweet nay all these allurements suit with naught save luxury to virtue they bring shame alone the muses and athena sniggered at this comment the contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could do whatever he wanted to the loser the contest between apollo and marsyas by palma il giovane according to one account after the first round they both were deemed equal by the nysiads but in the next round apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance marsyas argued against this saying that apollo would have an advantage and accused apollo of cheating but apollo replied that since marsyas played the flute which needed air blown from the throat it was similar to singing and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all the nymphs decided that apollo argument was just apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time mesmerising the audience marsyas could not do this apollo was declared the winner and angered with marsyas haughtiness and his accusations decided to flay the satyr according to another account marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat out of shame he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for wine sack another variation is that apollo played his instrument upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument so the muses who were the judges declared apollo the winner apollo hung marsyas from tree to flay him marsyas flayed by the order of apollo by charles andré van loo apollo flayed the limbs of marsyas alive in cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge god he then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed marsyas flayed skin to nearby pine tree as lesson to the others marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas but apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away the lyre was later discovered by the muses and apollo sons linus and orpheus the muses fixed the middle string linus the string struck with the forefinger and orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it they took it back to apollo but the god who had decided to stay away from music for while laid away both the lyre and the pipes at delphi and joined cybele in her wanderings to as far as hyperborea contest with cinyras cinyras was ruler of cyprus who was friend of agamemnon cinyras promised to assist agamemnon in the trojan war but did not keep his promise agamemnon cursed cinyras he invoked apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise apollo then had lyre playing contest with cinyras and defeated him either cinyras committed suicide when he lost or was killed by apollo apollon raon versailles patron of

brygos potter signed tondo of an attic red figure cup bc musée du louvre artemis as the sister of apollo is thea apollousa that is she as female divinity represented the same idea that apollo did as male divinity in the pre hellenic period their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife and there seems to have been tradition which actually described artemis as the wife of apollo however this relationship was never sexual but spiritual which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the hellenic period apollo and artemis by gavin hamilton artemis like her brother is armed with bow and arrows she is the cause of sudden deaths of women she also is the protector of the young especially girls though she has nothing to do with oracles music or poetry she sometimes led the female chorus on olympus while apollo sang the laurel daphne was sacred to both artemis daphnaia had her temple among the lacedemonians at place called hypsoi apollo daphnephoros had temple in eretria place where the citizens are to take the oaths in later times when apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or helios artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the moon hecate hecate the goddess of witchcraft and magic is the chthonic counterpart of apollo they both are cousins since their mothers leto and asteria are sisters one of apollo epithets hecatos is the masculine form of hecate and both the names mean working from afar while apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and

great power apollo was seen being the male counterpart of athena being zeus favorite children they were given more powers and duties apollo and athena often took up the role as protectors of cities and were patrons of some of the important cities athena was the principle goddess of athens apollo was the principle god of sparta pallas athene visiting apollo on the parnassus by arnold houbraken as patrons of arts apollo and athena were companions of the muses the former much more frequent companion than the latter apollo was sometimes called the son of athena and hephaestus due to his wise and artistic nature in the trojan war as zeus executive apollo is seen holding the aegis like athena usually does apollo decisions were usually approved by his sister athena and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by zeus apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies female of vengeance apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he drives them away he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollo supplicant apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus there was tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus on the occasion of pestilence in the bce apollo first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare during the second punic war in bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of prophecy attributed to one marcius in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium which was fought near sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollo temple dedicated portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected new temple to the god on the palatine hill sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in bce to celebrate the dawn of new era festivals the chief apollonian festival was the pythian games held every four years at delphi and was one of the four great panhellenic games also of major importance was the delia held every four years on delos athenian annual festivals included the boedromia metageitnia pyanepsia and thargelia spartan annual festivals were the carneia and the hyacinthia thebes every nine years held the daphnephoria attributes and symbols apollo most common attributes were the bow and arrow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollo honor every four years at delphi the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games gold stater of the seleucid king antiochus soter reigned bce showing on the reverse nude apollo holding his key attributes two arrows and bow the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas symbolizing music and song ravens hawks crows apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers snakes referencing apollo function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin homer and porphyry wrote that apollo had hawk as his messenger in many myths apollo is transformed into hawk in addition claudius aelianus wrote that in ancient egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of apollo in egypt there were certain men called hawk keepers ἱερακοβοσκοί who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of apollo in egypt and that the city symbol is man with hawklike face horus claudius aelianus wrote that egyptians called apollo horus in their own language apollo citharoedus apollo with kithara musei capitolini rome as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization bce according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy however this story may reflect cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention an asia minor god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars in this interpretation apollo title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god supposed link with wolves possibly folk etymology in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase apollo is often associated with the golden mean this is the greek ideal of moderation and virtue that opposes gluttony apollo in the arts the louvre apollo sauroctonos roman copy after praxiteles bc apollo is common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance the earliest greek word for statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially religious activity the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in relative harmonious whole in late archaic period in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole method created by polykleitos finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are mixture of naturalism with stylization art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the natural philosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras thales searched for simple material form directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on transcendental mathematical relation the forms on earth are imperfect imitations eikones images of the celestial world of numbers his ideas had great influence on post archaic art the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas the greek words oida know and eidos species thing seen have the same root as the word idea thing ἰδείν to see indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses the artists in plato time moved away from his theories and art tends to be mixture of naturalism with stylization the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual archaic sculpture kerameikos archaeological museum in athens kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo the first statues are certainly still and formal the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egyptian precedent but it was accepted for good reason the sculptors had clear idea of what young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods the adoption of standard recognizable type for long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented these forms expressed immortality apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order his shrine in delphi that he shared in winter with dionysius had the inscriptions gnōthi seautón know thyself and mēdén ágan nothing in excess and eggýa pára atē make pledge and mischief is nigh new york kouros met mus marble bc metropolitan museum of art in the first large scale depictions during the early archaic period bc the artists tried to draw one attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself piraeus apollo archaic style bronze archaeological museum of piraeus the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in specific moment these free standing statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period bc in which the greek sculpture attained full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create relative harmonious whole ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and cup of pouring libation in its right hand it probably comes from north eastern peloponnesus the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in post archaic art the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionian influence in athens finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later classical sculpture apollo of the mantoua type marble roman copy after th century bce greek original attributed to polykleitos musée du louvre at the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions the artists tried also to represent motion in specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm the type is represented by neo attic imperial roman copies of the late st or early nd century modelled upon supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the th century bce in style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze age just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of work of art spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in single unity pediments and friezes temple of zeus olympia greece in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had problem to fit group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration their two figures hold the centre in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene head of the apollo belvedere these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in larger whole while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest passage to and from busy battlefield the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought greater freedom and economy hellenistic greece rome apollo as handsome beardless young man is often depicted with kithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types the apollo belvedere is marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the th century the marble is hellenistic or roman copy of bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between and bce the life size so called adonis found in on the site of villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars in the late nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even god divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the rd century bce to depict alexander the great some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed modern reception apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature percy bysshe shelley composed hymn of apollo and the god instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinsky apollon musagète in the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdom dionysus bringer of love in discussion of the arts distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity friedrich nietzsche argued that fusion of the two was most desirable carl jung apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over intellectualise and maintain emotional distance charles handy in gods of management uses greek gods as metaphor to portray various types of organisational culture apollo represents role culture where order reason and bureaucracy prevail in spaceflight the and nasa program for orbiting and landing astronauts on the moon was named apollo

in the as sampras and agassi were the most successful players of that decade they also had very contrasting playing styles with sampras being considered the greatest server and agassi the greatest serve returner at the time agassi and sampras met times on the tour level with agassi trailing the us open was their first meeting in grand slam tournament final agassi was favored as he was ranked no at the time compared to the no ranking of sampras and because agassi had defeated sampras in their only previously completed match agassi however lost the final to sampras in straight sets their next meeting in grand slam was at the french open where they met in the quarterfinals although sampras was ranked higher agassi came out winning in straight sets they met again on grand slam level at the quarterfinals of wimbledon in where agassi was the defending champion and sampras was the newly minted world no agassi dug himself out from two sets to love hole levelling the match at sets apiece however sampras prevailed in five sets and went on to win his first wimbledon championship with both sampras and agassi participating the us won the davis cup in the year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won out of major titles meeting each other twice in the finals and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year they met times during the year all in the title matches including the australian open the newsweek champions cup now indian wells the lipton international players championships now miami open the canadian open and the us open

withdraw from that year us open which agassi went on to win they faced each other twice in the season ending atp tour world championships with sampras losing the round robin match but winning the

history because of the level of play presented by both players their last meeting was the final of the us open which was their third meeting in us open final but the first since the match was also

chang was the opponent agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than sampras they met times on the tour level with agassi leading chang unlike most of agassi big rivals had playing

rivalry began late in the with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of american tennis players and both having foreign descent agassi won the first four matches including straight set victory in round of the us open and defeating chang the defending champion in the french open in four set quarterfinal arguably their best match took place in the round of of the us open while both players presented high quality shot making the momentum changed from set to set with agassi eventually prevailing in five set victory it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first us open title their next two grand slam meetings came in with chang recording easy straight set victories in the semi finals of both the australian open and the us open years after agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face boris becker who was awaiting the winner in the final agassi won the last

won in three sets agassi vs rafter agassi and pat rafter played fifteen times with agassi leading the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters because of the players

surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the rome masters they played four matches at wimbledon with both winning two matches each agassi won the first two in and while rafter took their and

the end of the partnership on march stating that there were too many disagreements in the relationship playing style early in his career agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first strike tennis typically by inducing weak return with deep hard shot and then playing winner at an extreme angle on the rare occasion that he charged the net agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit swinging volley for winner his favored groundstroke was his flat accurate two handed backhand hit well cross court but especially down the line his forehand was nearly as strong especially his inside out to the ad court agassi strength was in dictating play from the baseline and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise while he was growing up his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way when in control of point agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt winner and hit conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more this change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach brad gilbert in their first year together in gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted agassi two handed backhand down the line as his very best shot signature play later in his career was change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes this would often be followed by passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early major tournament success on the red clay of roland garros reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career despite grass being his worst surface his first major win was at the

the austroasiatic languages also known as mon khmer are large language family of mainland southeast asia also scattered throughout parts of india bangladesh nepal and southern china there are around million speakers of austroasiatic languages of these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have long established recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status as modern national languages in vietnam and cambodia respectively the mon language is recognised indigenous language in myanmar and thailand in myanmar the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state santali is one of the scheduled languages of india the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status ethnologue identifies austroasiatic languages these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen which is poorly attested as fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon khmer and munda however one recent classification posits three groups munda nuclear mon khmer and khasi khmuic while another has abandoned mon khmer as taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family austroasiatic languages have disjunct distribution across southeast asia and parts of india bangladesh nepal and east asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken they appear to be the extant autochthonous languages of mainland southeast asia excluding the andaman islands with the neighboring kra dai hmong mien austronesian and sino tibetan languages being the result of later migrations etymology the name austroasiatic comes from combination of the latin words for south and asia hence south asia typology regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by stressed full syllable this reduction of presyllables has led to variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original proto austroasiatic prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely non existent in most branches except munda and few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have three or even four way voicing contrast however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained more typically austroasiatic structure proto language much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon khmer in harry shorto mon khmer comparative dictionary little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented with their demotion from primary branch proto mon khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic paul sidwell reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in internal classification linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh parts of nepal however no evidence for this classification has ever been published each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as valid clade by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accepts traditional mon khmer as valid unit however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic

malaysia and thailand monic languages the mon language of burma and the nyahkur language of thailand sidwell paul sidwell and roger blench propose that the austroasiatic phylum dispersed via the mekong river drainage basin paul sidwell in comparison of languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence sidwell blench discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for khasi palaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic if this would the case sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward sidwell blench suggest shompen as an additional branch and believe that vieto katuic connection is worth investigating in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for deeply nested structure to have developed since proto austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly subsequently sidwell proposed that nicobarese subgroups with aslian just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis of the austroasiatic language family by sidwell suggests that austroasiatic branches may have loosely nested structure rather than completely rake like structure with an east west division consisting of munda khasic palaungic and khmuic forming western group as opposed to all of the other branches occurring possibly as early as years before present integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings paul sidwell further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china sidwell tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up years during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river watershed of lingnan which would have been either coastal route down the coast of vietnam or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan both the reconstructed lexicon of proto austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around cultivated rice and millet kept livestock such as dogs pigs and chickens and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments at this neolithic package suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre neolithic hunter gatherer cultures with grain husks found in northern indochina by and in southern indochina by however sidwell found that iron is not reconstructable in proto austroasiatic since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai chinese tibetan malay and other languages during the iron age about relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic katuic pearic and khmer were formed while the more internally diverse bahnaric branch dating to about underwent more extensive internal diversification by the iron age all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present day locations with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age paul sidwell considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around years during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina but notes that the origin of proto austroasiatic itself is older than that date the lexicon of proto austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts animal names natural features and pronouns while the names of cultural items agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts which are reconstructable in proto austroasiatic form part of the later stratum roger blench suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies such as boats waterways river fauna and fish capture techniques can be reconstructed for proto austroasiatic blench finds widespread austroasiatic roots for river valley boat fish catfish sp eel prawn shrimp central austroasiatic crab tortoise turtle otter crocodile heron fishing bird and fish trap archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina northern vietnam laos and other nearby areas dates back to only about years bc with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to hence this points to relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to sino tibetan whose speakers had distinct non riverine culture in addition to living an aquatic based lifestyle early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock crops and newer types of watercraft as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area such as sino tibetan possible extinct branches roger blench also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct based on substrate evidence in modern day languages pre chamic languages the languages of coastal vietnam before the chamic migrations chamic has various austroasiatic loanwords that cannot be clearly traced to existing austroasiatic branches sidwell larish also notes that moklenic languages contain many austroasiatic loanwords some of which are similar to the ones found in chamic acehnese substratum sidwell acehnese has many basic words that are of austroasiatic origin suggesting that either austronesian speakers have absorbed earlier austroasiatic residents in northern sumatra or that words might have been borrowed from austroasiatic languages in southern vietnam or perhaps combination of both sidwell argues that acehnese and chamic had often borrowed austroasiatic words independently of each other while some austroasiatic words can be traced back to proto aceh chamic sidwell accepts that acehnese and chamic are related but that they had separated from each other before chamic had borrowed most of its austroasiatic lexicon bornean substrate languages blench blench cites austroasiatic origin words in modern day bornean branches such as land dayak bidayuh dayak bakatiq etc dusunic central dusun visayan etc kayan and kenyah noting especially resemblances with aslian as further evidence for his proposal blench also cites ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in borneo shared in common with austroasiatic speaking groups in mainland southeast asia adelaar has also noticed phonological and lexical similarities between land dayak and aslian lepcha substratum rongic many words of austroasiatic origin have been noticed in lepcha suggesting sino tibetan superstrate laid over an austroasiatic substrate blench calls this branch rongic based on the lepcha autonym róng other languages with proposed austroasiatic substrata are jiamao based on evidence from the register system of jiamao hlai language thurgood jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary in relation to other hlai languages kerinci van reijn notes that kerinci malayic language of central sumatra shares many phonological similarities with austroasiatic languages such as sesquisyllabic word structure and vowel inventory john peterson suggests that pre munda languages may have once dominated the eastern indo gangetic plain and were then absorbed by indo aryan languages at an early date as indo aryan spread east peterson notes that eastern indo aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages while western indo aryan languages do not writing systems other than latin based alphabets many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer thai lao and burmese alphabets vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the th century the following are examples of past used alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages chữ

afroasiatic afro asiatic also known as afrasian and in older sources as hamito semitic or semito hamitic is large language family of about languages that are spoken predominantly in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel afroasiatic languages have over million native speakers the fourth largest number of any language family after indo european sino tibetan and niger congo the phylum has six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic and semitic by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is arabic de facto group of distinct language varieties within the semitic branch the languages that evolved from proto arabic have around million native speakers concentrated primarily in west asia and north africa in addition to languages spoken today afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as ancient egyptian which forms distinct branch of the family and akkadian biblical hebrew and old aramaic all of which are from the semitic branch the original homeland of the afroasiatic family and when the parent language proto afroasiatic was spoken are yet to be agreed upon by historical linguists proposed locations include the horn of africa north africa the eastern sahara and the levant etymology in the early th century linguists grouped the berber cushitic and egyptian languages within hamitic phylum in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum the terms hamitic and semitic were etymologically derived from the book of genesis which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem two sons of noah by the the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out friedrich müller introduced the name hamito semitic for the entire language family in his grundriss der maurice delafosse later coined the term afroasiatic often now spelled afro asiatic however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg formally proposed its adoption in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that hamitic was not valid group and that language cladistics did not reflect race individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker and lisramic hodge in lieu of hamito semitic the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the family constituent languages the term hamito semitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries as well as in the official census of the government of india distribution and branches interrelations between branches of afroasiatic lipiński some linguists proposals for grouping within afroasiatic scholars generally treat the afroasiatic language family as including the following five branches whereas omotic is disputed berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic semitic although there is general agreement on these six families linguists who study afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement in particular the omotic language branch is the most controversial member of afroasiatic because the grammatical formatives to which most linguists have given the greatest weight in classifying languages in the family are either absent or distinctly wobbly hayward greenberg and others considered it subgroup of cushitic whereas others have raised doubts about its being part of afroasiatic at all theil the afroasiatic identity of ongota is also broadly questioned as is its position within afroasiatic among those who accept it due to the mixed appearance of the language and paucity of research and data harold fleming proposes that ongota constitutes separate branch of afroasiatic bonny sands finds the proposal by savà and tosco the most convincing namely that ongota is an east cushitic language with nilo saharan substratum in other words it would appear that the ongota people once spoke nilo saharan language but then shifted to speaking cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier nilo saharan language beja sometimes listed as separate branch of afroasiatic is more often included in the cushitic branch which has substantial degree of internal diversity there is no consensus on the of the five non omotic branches of afroasiatic see subgrouping below this situation is not unusual even among long established language families scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the indo european languages for instance the extinct meroitic language has been proposed bruce trigger as an unclassified afroasiatic language because it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family but there is not enough evidence to secure classification fritz hintze the classification of kujargé within afroasiatic is not agreed upon blench notes that much of the basic vocabulary looks cushitic and speculates that kujarge could even be conservative language transitional between chadic and cushitic demographics in descending order of number of speakers widely spoken afroasiatic languages include arabic semitic the most widely spoken afroasiatic language has over million native speakers hausa chadic the dominant language of northern nigeria and southern niger spoken as first language by over million people and used as lingua franca by another million across west africa and the sahel oromo cushitic spoken in ethiopia and kenya by around million people amharic semitic spoken in ethiopia with over million native speakers in addition to millions of other ethiopians speaking it as second language somali cushitic spoken by million people in somalia djibouti eastern ethiopia and northeastern kenya afar cushitic spoken by around million people in ethiopia djibouti and eritrea shilha berber spoken by around million people in morocco tigrinya semitic spoken by around million people in eritrea and ethiopia kabyle berber spoken by around million people in algeria hebrew semitic spoken by around million people million native first language speakers and million second language speakers in israel and the jewish diaspora premodern hebrew is the liturgical language of judaism and of the samaritan people central atlas tamazight berber spoken by around million people in morocco riffian berber spoken by around million people in morocco gurage languages semitic group of languages spoken by more than million people in ethiopia maltese semitic spoken by around half million people in malta and the maltese diaspora it descended from classical arabic independently from modern arabic dialects features romance superstrates and has been written in the latin script since at least the th century assyrian neo aramaic semitic variety of modern aramaic spoken by more than people in the assyrian diaspora classification history in the th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together he perceived relationship between berber and semitic he knew of semitic through his study of arabic hebrew and aramaic in the course of the th century europeans also began suggesting such relationships in theodor benfey suggested language family consisting of semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic in the same year newman suggested relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain topic of dispute and uncertainty friedrich müller named the traditional hamito semitic family in in his grundriss der outline of linguistics and defined it as consisting of semitic group plus hamitic group containing egyptian berber and cushitic he excluded the chadic group it was the egyptologist karl richard lepsius who restricted hamitic to the non semitic languages in africa which are characterized by grammatical gender system this hamitic language group was proposed to unite various mainly north african languages including the ancient egyptian language the berber languages the cushitic languages the beja language and the chadic languages unlike müller lepsius considered that hausa and nama were part of the hamitic group these classifications relied in part on non linguistic anthropological and racial arguments both authors used the skin color mode of subsistence and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together distribution of the afroasiatic hamito semitic languages in africa in carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten the languages of the hamites in which he expanded lepsius model adding the fula maasai bari nandi sandawe and hadza languages to the hamitic group meinhof model was widely supported into the meinhof system of classification of the hamitic languages was based on belief that speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially caucasian origins intrinsically different from and superior to the negroes of africa however in the case of the so called nilo hamitic languages concept he introduced it was based on the typological feature of gender and fallacious theory of language mixture meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub nilo hamitic were in fact nilotic languages with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other nilotic languages leo reinisch had already proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging their more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic however his suggestion found little acceptance marcel cohen rejected the idea of distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa chadic language in his comparative hamito semitic vocabulary finally joseph greenberg work led to the widespread rejection of hamitic as language category by linguists greenberg refuted meinhof linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence in dismissing the notion of separate nilo hamitic language category in particular greenberg was returning to view widely held half century earlier he consequently rejoined meinhof so called nilo hamitic languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings he also added and sub classified the chadic languages and proposed the new name afroasiatic for the family almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus greenberg model was fully developed in his book the languages of africa in which he reassigned most of meinhof additions to hamitic to other language families notably nilo saharan following isaac schapera and rejecting meinhof he classified the khoekhoe language as member of the khoisan languages grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds to khoisan he also added the tanzanian hadza and sandawe though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be linguistic isolates despite this greenberg classification remains starting point for modern work of many languages spoken in africa and the hamitic category and its extension to nilo hamitic has no part in this since the three traditional branches of the hamitic languages berber cushitic and egyptian have not been shown to form an exclusive monophyletic phylogenetic unit of their own separate from other afroasiatic languages linguists no longer use the term in this sense each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family in harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name omotic this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance based on typological differences with the other cushitic languages robert hetzron proposed that beja has to be removed from cushitic thus forming an independent branch of afroasiatic most scholars however reject this proposal and continue to group beja as the sole member of northern branch within cushitic glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge it therefore splits off the following groups as small families south omotic mao dizoid gonga gimojan north omotic apart from the preceding ongota kujarge subgrouping proposed afroasiatic sub divisions greenberg newman fleming post ehret semitic egyptian berber cushitic northern cushitic equals beja central cushitic eastern cushitic western cushitic equals omotic southern cushitic chadic berber chadic egypto semitic cushitic excludes omotic omotic erythraean cushitic

little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic semitic egyptian berber chadic cushitic and omotic however christopher ehret harold fleming and joseph greenberg all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first otherwise paul newman groups berber with chadic and egyptian with semitic while questioning the inclusion of omotic in afroasiatic rolf theil concurs with the exclusion of omotic but does not otherwise address the structure of the family harold fleming divides non omotic afroasiatic or erythraean into three groups cushitic semitic and chadic berber egyptian he later added semitic and beja to chadic berber egyptian and tentatively proposed ongota as new third branch of erythraean he thus divided afroasiatic into two major branches omotic and erythraean with erythraean consisting of three sub branches cushitic chadic berber egyptian semitic beja and ongota like harold fleming christopher ehret divides afroasiatic into two branches omotic and erythrean he divides omotic into two branches north omotic and south omotic he divides erythrean into cushitic comprising beja agaw and east south cushitic and north erythrean comprising chadic and boreafrasian according to his classification boreafrasian consists of egyptian berber and semitic vladimir orel and olga stolbova group berber with semitic and chadic with egyptian they split up cushitic into five or more independent branches of afroasiatic viewing cushitic as sprachbund rather than language family igor diakonoff subdivides afroasiatic in two grouping berber cushitic and semitic together as east west afrasian esa and chadic with egyptian as north south afrasian nsa he excludes omotic from afroasiatic lionel bender groups berber cushitic and semitic together as macro cushitic he regards chadic and omotic as the branches of afroasiatic most remote from the others alexander militarev on the basis of groups berber with chadic and both more distantly with semitic as against cushitic and omotic he places ongota in south omotic position among the world languages afroasiatic is one of the four major language families spoken in africa identified by joseph greenberg in his book the languages of africa it is one of the few whose speech area is with languages from afroasiatic semitic branch also spoken in the middle east and europe there are no generally accepted relations between afroasiatic and any other language family however several proposals grouping afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made the best known of these are the following hermann möller argued for relation between semitic and the indo european languages this proposal was accepted by few linguists holger pedersen and louis hjelmslev for fuller account see indo semitic languages however the theory has little currency today although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families such as grammatical gender noun adjective agreement three way number distinction and vowel alternation as means of derivation apparently influenced by möller colleague of his at the university of copenhagen holger pedersen included hamito semitic the term replaced by afroasiatic in his proposed nostratic macro family cf pedersen also included the indo european uralic altaic yukaghir languages and dravidian languages this inclusion was retained by subsequent nostraticists starting with vladislav illich svitych and aharon dolgopolsky joseph greenberg did not reject relationship of afroasiatic to these other languages but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other grouping instead these other languages in separate macro family which he called eurasiatic and to which he added chukotian gilyak korean japanese ryukyuan eskimo aleut and ainu most recently sergei starostin school has accepted eurasiatic as subgroup of nostratic with afroasiatic dravidian and kartvelian in nostratic outside of eurasiatic the even larger borean super family contains nostratic as well as dené caucasian and austric date of afroasiatic neo aramaic language descendant of old aramaic the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription dated to bc years ago symbols on gerzean naqada ii pottery resembling egyptian hieroglyphs date back to bc suggesting an earlier possible dating this gives us minimum date for the age of afroasiatic however ancient egyptian is highly divergent from proto afroasiatic trombetti and considerable time must have elapsed in between them estimates of the date at which the proto afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely they fall within range between approximately bc years ago and approximately bc years ago according to igor diakonoff proto afroasiatic was spoken bc christopher ehret asserts that proto afroasiatic was spoken bc at the latest and possibly as early as bc these dates are older than those associated with other proto languages afroasiatic urheimat map showing one of the proposed afroasiatic urheimat eastern sahara theory the term afroasiatic urheimat urheimat meaning original homeland in german refers to the hypothetical place where proto afroasiatic language speakers lived in single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel their distribution seems to have been influenced by the sahara pump operating over the last years there is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed the main theories of urheimat are the levant

valleys of andorra and facing the carthaginian army in its passage through the pyrenees during the punic wars the word andosini or andosins ἀνδοσίνοι may derive from the basque handia whose meaning is

water another theory suggests that andorra may derive from meaning the thickly wooded place when the arabs and moors conquered the iberian peninsula the valleys of the high pyrenees were covered by

gipa the grup intervenció policia andorra gipa is small special forces unit trained in counter terrorism and hostage recovery tasks although it is the closest in style to an active military force it is part of the police corps and not the army as terrorist and hostage situations are rare threat to the country the gipa is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties and at other times to routine policing fire brigade the andorran fire brigade with headquarters at santa coloma operates from four modern fire stations and has staff of around firefighters the service is equipped with heavy appliances fire tenders turntable ladders and specialist four wheel drive vehicles four light support vehicles cars and vans and four ambulances historically the families of the six ancient parishes of andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires the first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in serious fires which lasted for two days in december led to calls for permanent fire service and the andorran fire brigade was formed on april the fire service maintains full time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigade

stream the gran valira river leaves the country for spain at andorra lowest point of andorra land area is andorra belongs to the atlantic european province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom according to the wwf the territory of andorra belongs to the ecoregion of pyrenees conifer and mixed forests climate andorra has alpine continental and oceanic climates depending on altitude its higher elevation means there is on average more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer the diversity of landmarks the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the mediterranean climates make the country have great diversity of microclimates that hinder the general dominance of the high mountain climate the great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points together with the influence of mediterranean climate develop the climate of the andorran pyrenees when in precipitation global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer which can last until autumn may june and august are usually the rainiest months in winter however it is less rainy except in the highlands subject to the influence of fronts from the atlantic which explains the great amount of snowfall in the andorran mountains the temperature regime is characterized broadly by temperate summer and long and cold winter

economy accounts for roughly of gdp an estimated million tourists visit annually attracted by andorra duty free status and by its summer and winter resorts one of the main sources of income in andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over of ski ground the sport brings in over million visitors annually and an estimated million euros per year sustaining direct and indirect jobs at present since the banking sector with its tax haven status also contributes substantially to the economy with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately of gdp however during the european sovereign debt crisis of the st century the tourist industry suffered decline partly caused by drop in the prices of goods in spain undercutting duty free shopping and increasing unemployment on january business tax of was introduced followed by sales tax of year later which raised just over million euros in its first quarter agricultural production is limited only of the land is arable and most food has to be imported some tobacco is grown locally the principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes cigars and furniture andorra natural resources include hydroelectric power mineral water timber iron ore and lead andorra is not member of the european union but enjoys special relationship with it such as being treated as an eu member for trade in manufactured goods no tariffs and as non eu member for agricultural products andorra lacked currency of its own and used both the french franc and the spanish peseta in banking transactions until december when both currencies were replaced by the eu single currency the euro coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in andorra until december andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins beginning in andorra has traditionally had one of the world lowest unemployment rates in it stood at on may it was announced that andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of june against background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among eu members the announcement was made following meeting in paris between the head of government antoni marti and the french president and prince of andorra françois hollande hollande welcomed the move

in mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean stress on first and third syllables of arithmetic or simply the mean or the average when the context is clear is the sum of collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection the collection is often set of results of an experiment or an observational study or frequently set of results from survey the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as economics anthropology and history and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of nation population while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies it is not robust statistic meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values notably for skewed distributions such as the distribution of income for which few people incomes are substantially greater than most people the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one notion of middle and robust statistics such as the median may provide better description of central tendency definition given data set the arithmetic mean or mean or average denoted read bar is the mean of the values the arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in data set in statistics the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency the arithmetic mean of set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations symbolically if we have data set consisting of the values then the arithmetic mean is defined by the formula for an explanation of the summation operator see summation for example consider the monthly salary of employees of firm the arithmetic mean is if the data set is statistical population consists of every possible observation and not just subset of them then the mean of that population is called the population mean and denoted by the greek letter if the data set is statistical sample subset of the population then we call the statistic resulting from this calculation sample mean which for data set is denoted as the arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimension not only scalar values this is often referred to as centroid more generally because the arithmetic mean is convex combination coefficients sum to it can be defined on convex space not only vector space motivating properties the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful especially as measure of central tendency these include if numbers have mean then since is the distance from given number to the mean one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean the mean is the only single number for which the residuals deviations from the estimate sum to zero if it is required to use single number as typical value for set of known numbers then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value the sum of it follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error if the arithmetic mean of population of numbers is desired then the estimate of it that is unbiased is the arithmetic mean of sample drawn from the population contrast with median the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median the median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than and no more than half are smaller than the median if elements in the data increase arithmetically when placed in some order then the median and arithmetic average are equal for example consider the data sample the average is as is the median however when we consider sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically such as the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly in this case the arithmetic average is while the median is in general the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample and can be larger or smaller than most of them there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields for example since the the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income generalizations weighted average weighted average or weighted mean is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation for example the arithmetic mean of and is or equivalently in contrast weighted mean in which the first number receives for example twice as much weight as the second perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled would be calculated as here the weights which necessarily sum to the value one are and the former being twice the latter the arithmetic mean sometimes called the unweighted average or equally weighted average can be interpreted as special case of weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other equal to in the above example and equal to in situation with numbers being averaged continuous probability distributions comparison of two log normal distributions with equal median but different skewness resulting in different means and modes if numerical property and any sample of data from it could take on any value from continuous range instead of for example just integers then the probability of number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating continuous probability distribution across this range even when the naive probability for sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero the analog of weighted average in this context in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range is called the mean of the probability distribution most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution it has the property that all measures of its central tendency including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode the three are equal to each other this equality does not hold for other probability distributions as illustrated for the lognormal distribution here angles particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or angles naively taking the arithmetic mean of and yields result of this is incorrect for two reasons firstly angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of or if measuring in radians thus one could as easily call these and or and since each one of them gives different average secondly in this situation equivalently is geometrically better average value there is lower dispersion about it the points are both from it and from the putative average in general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation viz define the mean as the central point the point about which one has the lowest dispersion and redefine the difference as modular distance the distance on the circle so the modular distance between and is not symbols and encoding the arithmetic mean is often denoted by bar for example as in read bar some software text processors web browsers may not display the symbol properly for example the symbol in html is actually combination of two codes the base letter plus code for the line above or in some texts such as pdfs the symbol may be replaced by cent symbol unicode when copied to text processor such as microsoft word see also fréchet mean generalized mean geometric mean harmonic mean inequality of arithmetic and geometric means mode sample mean and covariance standard deviation standard error of the mean summary statistics references further reading external links calculations and comparisons between

the american football conference afc is one of the two conferences of the national football league nfl the highest professional level of american football in the united states this conference and its counterpart the national football conference nfc currently contain teams organized into divisions both conferences were created as part of the merger with the rival american football league afl with all ten of the former afl teams and three nfl teams forming the afc and the remaining thirteen nfl clubs forming the nfc series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger thus making the current total of clubs in each conference the current afc champions are the kansas city chiefs who defeated the tennessee titans in the afc championship game for their first conference championship in team history teams like the nfc the conference has teams organized into four divisions each with four teams east north south and west division team location stadium ref east

giants bears buccaneers rams th redskins lions panthers cardinals this chart of the season standings displays an application of the nfl scheduling formula the chiefs in highlighted in green finished in first place in the afc west thus in the chiefs will play two games against each of its division rivals highlighted in light blue one game against each team in the afc east and nfc south highlighted in yellow and one game each against the first place finishers in the afc north and afc south highlighted in orange currently the thirteen opponents each team faces over the game regular season schedule are set using pre determined formula each afc team plays the other teams in their respective division twice home and away during the regular season in addition to other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl two of these games are assigned on the basis of particular team final divisional standing from the previous season the remaining games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions this assignment shifts each year and will follow standard cycle using the regular season schedule as an example each team in the afc west plays against every team in the afc north and nfc south in this way non divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents the exception being the two games assigned based on the team prior season divisional standing at the end of each season the four division winners and two wild cards non division winners with best regular season record in the afc qualify for the playoffs the afc playoffs culminate in the afc championship game with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy the afc champion then plays the nfc champion in the super bowl history original american football conference logo based on the afl logo with blue stars both the afc and the nfc were created after the nfl merged with the american football league afl in the afl began play in with eight teams and added two more expansion clubs the miami dolphins in and the cincinnati bengals in before the merger in order to equalize the number of teams in each conference three nfl teams that predated the afl launch the cleveland browns pittsburgh steelers and the then baltimore colts joined the ten former afl teams to form the afc the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact while the nfl century division in which the browns and the steelers had played since was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central upon the completion of the merger of the afl and nfl in the newly minted american football conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the season the national football conference however could not agree upon their setup and one was chosen from fishbowl on january since the merger five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left thus making the current total when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as result of the realignment the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in there have been five teams that have relocated at least once in the baltimore colts relocated to indianapolis in the cleveland browns had attempted to move to baltimore the resulting dispute between cleveland and the team led to modell establishing the baltimore ravens with the players and personnel from the browns while the browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the nfl the ravens were treated as an expansion team in california the oakland raiders relocated to los angeles in back to oakland in and then to las vegas in while the san diego chargers returned to los angeles in after years in san diego the houston oilers moved to tennessee in where they were renamed the tennessee oilers the team would change its name again two years later to the tennessee titans the nfl would again expand in adding the houston texans to the afc with the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time the divisional setup has remained static ever since between and the afc has sent only half of its teams to the super bowl new england patriots times denver broncos times pittsburgh steelers times baltimore ravens times indianapolis colts times kansas city chiefs time las vegas raiders time and tennessee titans time by contrast the nfc has sent of the nfc teams during that same time frame with only the detroit lions minnesota vikings and washington football team missing out on an appearance in the super bowl of the last afc champions have started one of just three quarterbacks tom brady peyton manning and ben roethlisberger in the super bowl the afc has started quarterbacks in the last super bowls while the nfc has started logo px the merged league created new logo for the afc that took elements of the old afl logo specifically the and the six stars surrounding it the afc logo basically remained unchanged from to the nfl season introduced an updated afc logo with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars leaving four representing the four divisions of the afc and moving the stars inside the letter similar to the nfc logo television nbc aired the afc sunday afternoon and playoff games from through the season from to cbs was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the afc in those years all interconference games in which the afc team was the visiting team were broadcast on either nbc or cbs since the cross flex policy allows select afc games that involve them playing an nfc team at home or intraconference games to be moved from cbs to fox since select afc playoffs games have been seen on abc or espn references
animal farm is an allegorical novella by george orwell first published in england on august the book tells the story of group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer hoping to create society where the animals can be equal free and happy ultimately however the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up in state as bad as it was before under the dictatorship of pig named napoleon according to orwell the fable reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of and then on into the stalinist era of the soviet union orwell democratic socialist was critic of joseph stalin and hostile to moscow directed stalinism an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the spanish civil war the soviet union had become brutal dictatorship built upon cult of personality and enforced by reign of terror in letter to yvonne davet orwell described animal farm as satirical tale against stalin and in his essay why write wrote that animal farm was the first book in which he tried with full consciousness of what he was doing to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole the original title was animal farm fairy story but publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in and only one of the translations during orwell lifetime kept it other titular variations include subtitles like satire and contemporary satire orwell suggested the title for the french translation which abbreviates to ursa the latin word for bear symbol of russia it also played on the french name of the soviet union orwell wrote the book between november and february when the united kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the soviet union against nazi germany and the british intelligentsia held stalin in high esteem phenomenon orwell hated the manuscript was initially rejected by number of british and american publishers including one of orwell own victor gollancz which delayed its publication it became great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the cold war time magazine chose the book as one of the best english language novels to it also featured at number on the modern library list of best th century novels and number on the bbc the big read poll it won retrospective hugo award in and is included in the great books of the western world selection plot summary the poorly run manor farm near willingdon england is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer mr jones one night the exalted boar old major holds conference at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals revolutionary song called beasts of england when old major dies two young pigs snowball and napoleon assume command and stage revolt driving mr jones off the farm and renaming the property animal farm they adopt the seven commandments of animalism the most important of which is all animals are equal the decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn snowball teaches the animals to read and write while napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of animalism to commemorate the start of animal farm snowball raises green flag with white hoof and horn food is plentiful and the farm runs smoothly the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health following an unsuccessful attempt by mr jones and his associates to retake the farm later dubbed the battle of the cowshed snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building windmill napoleon disputes this idea and matters come to head which culminate in napoleon dogs chasing snowball away and napoleon declaring himself supreme commander napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm replacing meetings with committee of pigs who will run the farm through young porker named squealer napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea claiming that snowball was only trying to win animals to his side the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill when the animals find the windmill collapsed after violent storm napoleon and squealer persuade the animals that snowball is trying to sabotage their project and begin to purge the farm of animals napoleon accuses of consorting with his old rival when some animals recall the battle of the cowshed napoleon who was nowhere to be found during the battle gradually smears snowball to the point of saying he is collaborator of mr jones even dismissing the fact that snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle beasts of england is replaced with animal farm while an anthem glorifying napoleon who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of man comrade napoleon is composed and sung napoleon then conducts second purge during which many animals who claim to be helping snowball in plots are executed by napoleon dogs which troubles the rest of the animals despite their hardships the animals are easily placated by napoleon retort that they are better off than they were under mr jones as well as by the sheep continual bleating of four legs good two legs bad mr frederick neighbouring farmer attacks the farm using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill although the animals win the battle they do so at great cost as many including boxer the workhorse are wounded although he recovers from this boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill being almost years old at that point he is taken away in knacker van and donkey called benjamin alerts the animals of this but squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner signboard had not been repainted squealer subsequently reports boxer death and honours him with festival the following day however napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of boxer to the knacker allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves years pass the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed which makes the farm good amount of income however the ideals that snowball discussed including stalls with electric lighting heating and running water are forgotten with napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives in addition to boxer many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old mr jones having moved away after giving up on reclaiming his farm has also died the pigs start to resemble humans as they walk upright carry whips drink alcohol and wear clothes the seven commandments are abridged to just one phrase all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others the maxim four legs good two legs bad is similarly changed to four legs good two legs better other changes include the hoof and horn flag being replaced with plain green banner and old major skull which was previously put on display being reburied napoleon holds dinner party for the pigs and local farmers with whom he celebrates new alliance he abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name the manor farm the men and pigs start playing cards flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game both napoleon and mr pilkington one of the farmers play the ace of spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first when the animals outside look at the pigs and men they can no longer distinguish between the two characters pigs old major an aged prize middle white boar provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion he is also called willingdon beauty when showing he is an allegorical combination of karl marx one of the creators of communism and vladimir lenin the communist leader of the russian revolution and the early soviet nation in that he draws up the principles of the revolution his skull being put on revered public display recalls lenin whose embalmed body was put on display by the end of the book the skull is reburied napoleon large rather fierce looking berkshire boar the only berkshire on the farm not much of talker but with reputation for getting his own way an allegory of joseph stalin napoleon is the leader of animal farm snowball napoleon rival and original head of the farm after jones overthrow his life parallels that of leon trotsky but may also combine elements from lenin squealer small white fat porker who serves as napoleon second in command and minister of propaganda holding position similar to that of vyacheslav molotov minimus poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of animal farm after the singing of beasts of england is banned rodden compares him to the poet vladimir mayakovsky the piglets hinted to be the children of napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality the young pigs four pigs who complain about napoleon takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed the first animals killed in napoleon farm purge probably based on the great purge of grigori zinoviev lev kamenev nikolai bukharin and alexei rykov pinkeye minor pig who is mentioned only once he is the taste tester that samples napoleon food to make sure it is not poisoned in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on napoleon humans mr jones heavy drinker who is the original owner of manor farm farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job he is an allegory of russian tsar nicholas ii who abdicated following the february revolution of and was murdered along with the rest of his family by the bolsheviks on july the animals revolt after jones drinks so much he does not care for them mr frederick the tough owner of pinchfield farm small but well kept neighbouring farm who briefly enters into an alliance with napoleon animal farm shares land boundaries with pinchfield on one side and foxwood on another making animal farm buffer zone between the two bickering farmers the animals of animal farm are terrified of frederick as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with cockfighting likely allegory for the human rights abuses of adolf hitler napoleon enters into an alliance with frederick in order to sell surplus timber that pilkington also sought but is enraged to learn frederick paid him in counterfeit money shortly after the swindling frederick and his men invade animal farm killing many animals and destroying the windmill the brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the molotov ribbentrop pact and operation barbarossa mr pilkington the easy going but crafty and well to do owner of foxwood farm large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds pilkington is wealthier than frederick and owns more land but his farm is in need of care as opposed to frederick smaller but more efficiently run farm although on bad terms with frederick pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed jones and worried that this could also happen to him mr whymper man hired by napoleon to act as the liaison between animal farm and human society at first he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm such as dog biscuits and paraffin wax but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs equines boxer loyal kind dedicated extremely strong hard working and respectable cart horse although quite naive and gullible boxer does large share of the physical labour on the farm he is shown to hold the belief that napoleon is always right at one point he had challenged squealer statement that snowball was always against the welfare of the farm earning him an attack from napoleon dogs but boxer immense strength repels the attack worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged boxer has been compared to alexey stakhanov diligent and enthusiastic role model of the stakhanovite movement he has been described as faithful and strong he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder when boxer is injured napoleon sells him to local knacker to buy himself whisky and squealer gives moving account falsifying boxer death mollie self centred self indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution in manner similar to those who left russia after the fall of the tsar she is only once mentioned again clover gentle caring mare who shows concern especially for boxer who often pushes himself too hard clover can read all the letters of the alphabet but cannot put words together she seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by napoleon and squealer benjamin donkey one of the oldest wisest animals on the farm and one of the few who can read properly he is sceptical temperamental and cynical his most frequent remark is life will go on as it has always gone on that is badly the academic morris dickstein has suggested there is touch of orwell himself in this creature timeless scepticism and indeed friends called orwell donkey george after his grumbling donkey benjamin in animal farm other animals muriel wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm similarly to benjamin muriel is one of the few animals on the farm who is not pig but can read the puppies offspring of jessie and bluebell the puppies were taken away at birth by napoleon and raised by him to serve as his powerful security force moses the raven mr jones especial pet was spy and tale bearer but he was also clever talker initially following mrs jones into exile he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working he regales animal farm denizens with tales of wondrous place beyond the clouds called sugarcandy mountain that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours orwell portrays established religion as the black raven of priestcraft promising pie in the sky when you die and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power napoleon brings the raven back ch ix as stalin brought back the russian orthodox church the sheep they show limited understanding of animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm yet nonetheless they are the voice of blind conformity as they bleat their support napoleon ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with snowball their constant bleating of four legs good two legs bad was used as device to drown out any opposition or alternative views from snowball much as stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out trotsky towards the latter section of the book squealer the propagandist trains the sheep to alter their slogan to four legs good two legs better which they dutifully do the hens the hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs which are stolen from them under mr jones however their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside animal farm the hens are among the first to rebel albeit unsuccessfully against napoleon the cows the cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen but can be used to raise their own calves their milk is then stolen by the pigs who learn to milk them the milk is stirred into the pigs mash every day while the other animals are denied such luxuries the cat never seen to carry out any work the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions she has no interest in the politics of the farm and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election she is found to have actually voted on both sides genre style george orwell animal farm is an example of political satire that was intended to have wider application according to orwell himself in terms of its relevance stylistically the work shares many similarities with some of orwell other works most notably as both have been considered works of swiftian satire furthermore these two prominent works seem to suggest orwell bleak view of the future for humanity he seems to stress the potential current threat of dystopias similar to those in animal farm and in these kinds of works orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of europe following the second world war orwell style and writing philosophy as whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing orwell was committed to communicating in way that was straightforward given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse for this reason he is careful in animal farm to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion the difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly while the wicked animals on the farm such as napoleon twist language in such way that it meets their own insidious desires this style reflects orwell close proximation to the issues facing europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on stalin soviet russia background origin and writing george orwell wrote the manuscript between november and february after his experiences during the spanish civil war which he described in homage to catalonia in the preface of ukrainian edition of animal farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals homage to catalonia sold poorly after seeing arthur koestler best selling darkness at noon about the moscow trials orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism immediately prior to writing the book orwell had quit the bbc he was also upset about booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union such as directions to claim that the red terror was figment of nazi imagination in the preface orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on farm in the manuscript was almost destroyed when german flying bomb hit his london orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact publication publishing orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain the united states and the soviet union four publishers refused to publish animal farm yet one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the ministry of information eventually secker and warburg published the first edition in during the second world war it became clear to orwell that anti soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch including his regular publisher gollancz he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber where the poet eliot who was director of the firm rejected it eliot wrote back to orwell praising the book good writing and fundamental integrity but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which take to be generally trotskyite eliot said he found the view not convincing and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm he posited that someone might argue what was needed was not more communism but more public spirited pigs orwell let andré deutsch who was working for nicholson watson in read the typescript and deutsch was convinced that nicholson watson would want to publish it however they did not and lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in animal farm in his london letter on april for partisan review orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti russian printed anti russian books do appear but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from religious or frankly reactionary angle the publisher jonathan cape who had initially accepted animal farm subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be soviet spy writing to leonard moore partner in the literary agency of christy moore publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of senior official in the ministry of information such flagrant anti soviet bias was unacceptable and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive it may reasonably be assumed that the important official was man named peter smollett who was later unmasked as soviet agent orwell was suspicious of smollett smolka and he would be one of the names orwell included in his list of crypto communists and fellow travellers sent to the information research department in the publisher wrote to orwell saying frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the heroic red army which had played major part in defeating adolf hitler russian translation was printed in the paper posev and in giving permission for russian translation of animal farm orwell refused in advance all royalties translation in ukrainian which was produced in germany was confiscated in large part by the american wartime authorities and handed over to the soviet repatriation commission in october orwell wrote to frederic warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low might illustrate animal farm low had written letter saying that he had had good time with animal farm an excellent bit of satire it would illustrate perfectly nothing came of this and trial issue produced by secker warburg in illustrated by john driver was abandoned but the folio society published an edition in illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker warburg in to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of animal farm preface orwell originally wrote preface complaining about british self censorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr their world war ii ally although the first edition allowed space for the preface it was not included and as of june most editions of the book have not included it secker and warburg published the first edition of animal farm in without an introduction however the publisher had provided space for preface in the author proof composited from the manuscript for reasons unknown no preface was supplied and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute in ian angus found the original typescript titled the freedom of the press and bernard crick published it together with his own introduction in the times literary supplement on september as how the essay came to be written orwell essay criticised british self censorship by the press specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government the same essay also appeared in the italian edition of animal farm with another introduction by crick claiming to be the first edition with the preface other publishers were still declining to publish it reception contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive writing in the american new republic magazine george soule expressed his disappointment in the book writing that it puzzled and saddened me it seemed on the whole dull the allegory turned out to be creaking machine for saying in clumsy way things that have been said better directly soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations and said it seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous success arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced but rather with stereotyped ideas about country which he probably does not know very well the guardian on august called animal farm delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few tosco fyvel writing in tribune on the same day called the book gentle satire on certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us julian symons responded on september should we not expect in tribune at least acknowledgement of the fact that it is satire not at all gentle upon particular state soviet russia it seems to me that reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin and snowball with trotsky and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author upon political ground in hundred years time perhaps animal farm may be simply fairy story today it is political satire with good deal of point animal farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks the cia from to in operation aedinosaur sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into poland hungary and czechoslovakia whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down time magazine chose animal farm as one of the best english language novels to it also featured at number on the modern library list of best th century novels it won retrospective hugo award in and is included in the great books of the western world selection popular reading in schools animal farm was ranked the nation favourite book from school in uk poll animal farm has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the us the following are examples of this controversy that has existed around orwell work the john birch society in wisconsin challenged the reading of animal farm in because of its reference to masses revolting new york state english council committee on defense against censorship found that in animal farm had been widely deemed problem book censorship survey conducted in dekalb county georgia relating to the years revealed that many schools had attempted to limit access to animal farm due to its political theories superintendent in bay county florida bans animal farm at the middle school and high school levels in the board quickly brought back the book however after receiving complaints of the ban as animal farm was removed from school district curriculum in in stonington connecticut animal farm has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries the ala also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the international book fair in moscow russia in and banned from schools in the united arab emirates for references to practices or actions that defy arab or islamic beliefs such as pigs or alcohol in the same manner animal farm has also faced relatively recent issues in china in the government made the decision to censor all online posts about or referring to animal farm however the book itself as of remains sold in stores amy hawkins and jeffrey wasserstrom of the atlantic stated in that the book is widely available in mainland china for several reasons the general public by and large no longer reads books because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway and because the communist party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as liability the authors stated it was and remains as easy to buy and animal farm in shenzhen or shanghai as it is in london or los angeles an enhanced version of the book launched in india in was widely praised for capturing the author intent by republishing the proposed preface of the first edition and the preface he wrote for the ukrainian edition analysis animalism the pigs snowball napoleon and squealer adapt old major ideas into complete system of thought which they formally name animalism an allegoric reference to communism not to be confused with the philosophy animalism soon after napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the soviet government revising of history in order to exercise control of the people beliefs about themselves and their society squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the seven commandments were written ch viii preliminary artwork for strip cartoon by norman pett and donald freeman the original commandments are whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is friend no animal shall wear clothes no animal shall sleep in bed no animal shall drink alcohol no animal shall kill any other animal all animals are equal these commandments are also distilled into the maxim four legs good two legs bad which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism later napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law breaking the changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded no animal shall sleep in bed with sheets no animal shall drink alcohol to excess no animal shall kill any other animal without cause eventually these are replaced with the maxims all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and four legs good two legs better as the pigs become more human this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits through the revision of the commandments orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda significance and allegory the horn and hoof flag described in the book appears to be based on the hammer and sickle the communist symbol by the end of the book when napoleon takes full control the hoof and horn is removed from the flag orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory orwell himself wrote in of course intended it primarily as satire on the russian revolution and that kind of revolution violent conspiratorial revolution led by unconsciously power hungry people can only lead to change of masters revolutions only effect radical improvement when the masses are alert in preface for ukrainian edition he stated for the past ten years have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted revival of the socialist movement on my return from spain in thought of exposing the soviet myth in story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwell analogy with the october bolshevik revolution the battle of the cowshed has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war the pigs rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr just as napoleon emergence as the farm sole leader reflects stalin emergence the pigs appropriation of milk and apples for their own use the turning point of the story as orwell termed it in letter to dwight macdonald stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left wing kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure and the pigs treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the in chapter seven when the animals confess their non existent crimes and are killed orwell directly alludes to the purges confessions and show trials of the late these contributed to orwell conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten peter edgerly firchow and peter davison contend that the battle of the windmill specifically referencing the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow represents world war ii during the battle orwell first wrote all the animals including napoleon took cover orwell had the publisher alter this to all the animals except napoleon in recognition of stalin decision to remain in moscow during the german advance orwell requested the change after he met józef czapski in paris in march czapski survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime told orwell as orwell wrote to arthur koestler that it had been the character and greatness of stalin that saved russia from the german invasion rykov skrypnyk and stalin when snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep ch just as in the party congress in above at stalin instigation pleas for the opposition were drowned in the continual hysterically intolerant uproar from the floor isaac deutscher other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwell telescoping of russian history from to include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and in germany ch iv the conflict between napoleon and snowball ch parallelling the two rival and quasi messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another trotskyism with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west and stalinism with its glorification of russia socialist destiny napoleon dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ch vi paralleling the treaty of rapallo and frederick forged bank notes parallelling the hitler stalin pact of august after which frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill the book close with the pigs and men in kind of rapprochement reflected orwell view of the tehran conference that seemed to display the establishment of the best possible relations between the ussr and the west but in reality were destined as orwell presciently predicted to continue to unravel the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington both suspicious played an ace of spades simultaneously similarly the music in the novel starting with beasts of england and the later anthems parallels the internationale and its adoption and repudiation by the soviet authorities as the anthem of the ussr in the and adaptations films animal farm has been adapted to film twice both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties including sanitising some aspects animal farm is an animated film in which napoleon is eventually overthrown in second revolution in howard hunt revealed that he had been sent by the cia psychological warfare department to obtain the film rights from orwell widow and the resulting animation was funded by the agency animal farm is live action tv version that shows napoleon regime collapsing in on itself with the farm having new human owners reflecting the collapse of soviet communism in an hfr version of animal farm potentially directed by andy serkis was announced radio dramatizations bbc radio version produced by rayner heppenstall was

amphibians are ectothermic tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia all living amphibians belong to the group lissamphibia they inhabit wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air breathing form with lungs amphibians use their skin as secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin they are superficially similar to lizards but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicators in recent decades there has been dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony limbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia the three modern orders of amphibians are anura the frogs and toads urodela the salamanders and apoda the caecilians the number of known amphibian species is approximately of which nearly are frogs the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with length of just the largest living amphibian is the south china giant salamander andrias sligoi but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology classification the world smallest known vertebrate paedophryne amauensis sitting on dime the dime is mm in diameter for scale the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος amphíbios which means both kinds of life ἀμφί meaning of both kinds and βιος meaning life the term was initially used as general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct subclass lepospondyli small paleozoic group which are more closely related to amniotes than lissamphibia subclass temnospondyli diverse paleozoic and early mesozoic grade subclass lissamphibia all modern amphibians including frogs toads salamanders newts and caecilians salientia frogs toads and relatives jurassic to present current species in families caudata salamanders newts and relatives jurassic to present current species in families gymnophiona caecilians and relatives jurassic to present current species in families allocaudata middle jurassic early pleistocene triadobatrachus massinoti proto frog from the early triassic of madagascar the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known amphibian species as of march is exactly of which nearly are frogs with the phylogenetic classification the taxon has been discarded as it is group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use stem based or node based classification traditionally amphibians as class are defined as all tetrapods with larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibian type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes paraphyletic group all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered clade group of species that have evolved from common ancestor the three modern orders are anura the frogs and toads caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from temnospondyl like ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes although the fossils of several older proto frogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species eocaecilia micropodia also from arizona the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china authorities disagree as to whether salientia is superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is sub order of the order salientia the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamander like family the is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto frog triadobatrachus evolutionary history the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around million years ago from lobe finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish these ancient lobe finned fish had evolved multi jointed leg like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom some fish had developed primitive lungs that help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammals despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs it had four sturdy limbs neck tail with fins and skull very similar to that of the lobe finned fish eusthenopteron amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to support the weight of their bodies on land they developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation the fish hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra occipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom the permian lepospondyl diplocaulus was largely aquatic at the end of the devonian period million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in similar manner to that used by the elephant seal in the early carboniferous to million years ago the climate became wet and warm extensive swamps developed with mosses ferns horsetails and calamites air breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had long tapering body and strong tail they were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water they still needed to return to water to lay their shell less eggs and even most modern amphibians have fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors it was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles and amphibians were further devastated by the permian triassic extinction event during the triassic period to million years ago the reptiles continued to out compete the amphibians leading to reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests late carboniferous early permian origin for extant amphibians the temnospondyl eryops had sturdy limbs to support its body on land the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is matter of debate molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe finned fish the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils there are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of gerobatrachus hottoni from the early permian in texas in provided missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs molecular analysis suggests that the frog salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the evidence indicates newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about million years ago and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in terrestrial environment their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss characteristics the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps the anderson salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or salt water lakes on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp modern amphibians have simplified anatomy compared to their ancestors due to paedomorphosis caused by two evolutionary trends miniaturization and an unusually large genome which result in slower growth and development rate compared to other vertebrates another reason for their size is associated with their rapid metamorphosis which seems to have evolved only in the ancestors of lissamphibia in all other known lines the development was much more gradual because remodeling of the feeding apparatus means they don eat during the metamorphosis the metamorphosis has to go faster the smaller the individual is so it happens at an early stage when the larvae are still small the largest species of salamanders don go through metamorphosis amphibians that lay eggs on land often go through the whole metamorphosis inside the egg an anamniotic terrestrial egg is less than cm in diameter due to diffusion problems size which puts limit on the amount of posthatching growth the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in it has an average length of and is part of genus that contains four of the world ten smallest frog species the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed the extinct prionosuchus crocodile like temnospondyl dating to million years ago from the middle permian of brazil the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach and weigh amphibians are ectothermic cold blooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes their metabolic rate is low and as result their food and energy requirements are limited in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from few fish like scales in certain caecilians the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands type of granular gland the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults amphibians breathe by means of pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin anura red eyed tree frog agalychnis callidryas with limbs and feet specialised for climbing the order anura from the ancient greek meaning without and oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with warty skins are known as toads the difference is not formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads frogs range in size from the goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in which is also the smallest known vertebrate although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts they are found worldwide except for polar areas anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships the suborder contains four families of primitive frogs these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species ninety six percent of the over extant species of frog are neobatrachians caudata japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus primitive salamander the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamanders elongated low slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form this is trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals salamanders lack claws have scale free skins either smooth or covered with tubercles and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to length of to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds in length salamanders have mostly laurasian distribution being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene million years ago urodela is name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults most salamanders are under long they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates danube crested newt triturus dobrogicus an advanced salamander the suborder contains the primitive salamanders number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation in salamandrids the male deposits bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes of all salamander species the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in single family sirenidae members of this order are eel like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs some of their features are primitive while others are derived fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage despite this the eggs are laid singly behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation gymnophiona the limbless south american caecilian siphonops paulensis the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda comprises the caecilians these are long cylindrical limbless animals with snake or worm like form the adults vary in length from to centimetres to inches with the exception of thomson caecilian caecilia thompsoni which can reach caecilian skin has large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity it also has pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct caecilians have mostly gondwanan distribution being found in tropical regions of africa asia and central and south america anatomy and physiology skin bright colours of the common reed frog hyperolius viridiflavus are typical of toxic species the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes amphibians often eat the sloughed skin caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages cross section of frog skin mucous gland chromatophore granular poison gland connective tissue stratum corneum transition zone epidermis dermis amphibian skin is permeable to water gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect the main poison producing glands the parotoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing blue green colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is warning sign to predators skeletal system and locomotion skull diagram of xenotosuchus temnospondyl amphibians have skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with number of variations they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs the bones are hollow and lightweight the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the well developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by pair of sacral ribs the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals skeleton of the surinam horned frog ceratophrys cornuta in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel like in appearance with tiny stubby legs the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs the caecilians are limbless they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as prop particularly when climbing in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobe finned fish some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as means of propulsion adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones skull of yaksha perettii an extinct albanerpetontid salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in process known as autotomy certain species in the plethodontidae have weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape both tails and limbs can be regenerated adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so circulatory system didactic model of an amphibian heart juvenile amphibian circulatory systems are single loop systems which resemble fish internal gills where the blood is reoxygenated point where the blood is depleted of oxygen and returns to the heart via veins two chambered heart red indicates oxygenated blood and blue represents oxygen depleted blood amphibians have juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of fish the two chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated and is spread around the body and back to the heart in single loop in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs they have heart that consists of single ventricle and two atria when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers nervous and sensory systems the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with central brain spinal cord and nerves throughout the body the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of fish it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain the brain consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning the cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians some caecilians possess that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water the ears are well developed in frogs there is no external ear but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye this vibrates and sound is transmitted through single bone the stapes to the inner ear only high frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but low frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism there is patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the columella operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more dome shaped the lens becomes flatter and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes they allow colour vision and depth of focus in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to wide range of wavelengths digestive and excretory systems dissected frog right atrium liver aorta egg mass colon left atrium ventricle stomach left lung spleen small intestine cloaca many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey amphibians possess pancreas liver and gall bladder the liver is usually large with two lobes its size is determined by its function as glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen in internal structures called fat bodies under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail there are two kidneys located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid respiratory system the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum retains its larval form with gills into adulthood the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal septa and large alveoli and consequently having comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at sufficiently high rate because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontid salamanders which have neither lungs nor gills many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults reproduction male orange thighed frog litoria xanthomera grasping the female during amplexus for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist few fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations the pacific platymantis the australo papuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free standing water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often storm in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the and inserting it into the female cloaca the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation in most of these the male deposits spermatophore small packet of sperm on top of gelatinous cone on the substrate either on land or in the water the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and practice external fertilisation in similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass with few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm roughened nuptial pads on the male hands aid in retaining grip often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming sort of basket with the hind feet an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female this frog lives in fast flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders typically prolonged breeders congregate at breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over territory the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid the females depart and territories may change hands more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at breeding site they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find suitable place perhaps pool that forms in the same place each rainy season the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females sexual selection has been studied in the red back salamander there is direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with some species store sperm through long breeding seasons as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm life cycle most amphibians go through metamorphosis process of significant morphological change after birth in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxine effect specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues because most embryonic development is outside the parental body it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth whisker like skin extensions or fins they also make use of sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish after metamorphosis these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death called apoptosis the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide with many discoveries still being made eggs frogspawn mass of eggs surrounded by jelly amphibian egg jelly capsule vitelline membrane perivitelline fluid yolk plug embryo the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and this capsule is permeable to water and gases and swells considerably as it absorbs water the ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely this also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation caecilians some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups or may take the form of spherical egg masses rafts or long strings in terrestrial caecilians the eggs are laid in grape like clusters in burrows near streams the amphibious salamander ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots the greenhouse frog planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds floating nest from foam to protect its eggs first raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally foam cap is overlaid the foam has anti microbial properties it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female larvae early stages in the development of the embryos of the common frog rana temporaria the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the african live bearing toads nectophrynoides spp are viviparous their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female oviduct often for long periods other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparous the eggs are retained in or on the parent body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members frogs frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails with fins the free living larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are semi terrestrial and live among wet rocks tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by horny beak front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible few days later iodine and over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis programmed cell death of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting in fact tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies large caudal fins and small mouths they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths shallow bodies and caudal fins they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria they also feed on diatoms filtered from the water through the gills and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond ingesting edible fragments they have relatively long spiral shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalistic the younger tadpoles attacking larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely the spiral shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut the animal develops large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac eyes and legs grow quickly and tongue is formed there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system all this can happen in about day few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place salamanders larva of the long toed salamander ambystoma macrodactylum larva of the long toed salamander ambystoma macrodactylum larvae of the alpine newt ichthyosaura alpestris at hatching typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills somewhat laterally flattened body and long tail with dorsal and ventral fins the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water pond type larvae often have pair of balancers rod like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment some members of the genera ambystoma and dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult both of these are able to breed neoteny occurs when the animal growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of population that would otherwise die out there are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders including species of necturus proteus and amphiuma and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay small number of unpigmented eggs in cluster among damp leaf litter each egg has large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as juvenile salamander the female salamander often broods the eggs in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with mucous secretion in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and land phase in winter for adaptation to water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time caecilians the caecilian ichthyophis glutinosus with eggs and developing embryo most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus species from sri lanka has been much studied the eel like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water they have three pairs of external red feathery gills blunt head with two rudimentary eyes lateral line system and short tail with fins they swim by undulating their body from side to side they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land metamorphosis is gradual by the age of about ten months they have developed pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments by this time the caecilian has constructed burrow and is living on land ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus resembles an earthworm in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by viviparity typhlonectes compressicauda species from south america is typical of these up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time they are elongated and have paired sac like gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall they may increase their length sixfold and be two fifths as long as their mother before being born by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction the progeny feed on skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy the brood feed as batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca parental care male common rocket frog colostethus panamensis carrying tadpoles on his back the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place nevertheless it is estimated that in up to of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders the male hellbender primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans carrying eggs the male colostethus subpunctatus tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under stone or log when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by mucous secretion to temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off the male midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles the female gastric brooding frog rheobatrachus spp reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct the tadpoles secrete hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to suitable water filled crevice such as the axil of leaf or the rosette of bromeliad the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles feeding and diet northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile eating worm with few exceptions adult amphibians are predators feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders the sirens siren spp often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes large quantity of fruit in its diet the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light movement of the prey triggers feeding response frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves cave dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth feature unique to amphibians the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp have no teeth in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to facial bone in the roof of the mouth edible frog pelophylax esculentus exhibiting cannibalism the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates others amphibians such as the bufo spp toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well camouflaged caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward pointing teeth the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow the subdued prey is gulped down whole when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out others have specialised mouthparts consisting of horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic audio showing brazilian torrent frog males executing advertisement peep and squeal calls vocalization male treefrog dendropsophus microcephalus inflating his air sac as he calls the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks grunts or hisses and have not been much studied clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be means of orientation as in bats or form of communication most salamanders are considered voiceless but the california giant salamander dicamptodon ensatus has vocal cords and can produce rattling or barking sound some species of salamander emit quiet squeak or yelp if attacked american toad anaxyrus americanus singing frogs are much more vocal especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates the presence of particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by fleeting glimpse of the animal itself in most species the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth this may distend like balloon and acts as resonator helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere or the water at times when the animal is submerged the main vocalisation is the male loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory this call is modified to quieter courtship call on the approach of female or to more aggressive version if male intruder draws near calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy other calls include those given by female in response to the advertisement call and release call given by male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus when frog is attacked distress or fright call is emitted often resembling scream the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis produces rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours territorial behaviour little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs the red back salamander plethodon cinereus defends territory against intruders in salamanders defence of territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of tail the behaviour of red back salamanders plethodon cinereus has been much studied of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within metre yard of their original daytime retreat under log or rock similar proportion when moved experimentally distance of found their way back to their home base the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by male and female pair these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively if the intruder persisted biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso labial grooves damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates in general deeper voice represents heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by fitter rival if he tires there is tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders holders of territories have home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar sized frogs if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponent vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water defence mechanisms cane toad rhinella marina with poison glands behind the eyes amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in feeding experiment in brazil in some salamanders the skin is poisonous the rough skinned newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic non protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis in locations where both snake and salamander co exist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms altogether over toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated the fire salamander salamandra salamandra toxic species wears warning colours perhaps the most poisonous animal in the world the golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis is endemic to colombia poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example once predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters similar animal in some species such as the fire bellied toad bombina spp the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality strategy that may deceive predators many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by potential predator such as the north american northern short tailed shrew blarina brevicauda their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison producing granular glands few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape the tail may have constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with defensive bite the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape cognition in amphibians there is evidence of habituation associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning and discrimination abilities in one experiment when offered live fruit flies drosophila virilis salamanders chose the larger of vs and vs frogs can distinguish between low numbers vs vs but not vs and large numbers vs vs but not vs of prey this is irrespective of other characteristics surface area volume weight and movement although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area conservation the extinct golden toad bufo periglenes last seen in dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity in the international union for conservation of nature iucn reported stating that currently birds mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum times greater than natural extinction rates possibly times higher in there were believed to be species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle of these were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species global warming endocrine disrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are topic of ongoing discussion the hula painted frog discoglossus nigriventer was believed to be extinct but was rediscovered in with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators in many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species in the middle east growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline the western terrestrial garter snake thamnophis elegans in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers the yosemite toad bufo canorus and the mountain yellow legged frog rana muscosa putting the snake future at risk if the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences global strategy to stem the crisis was released in in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan developed by over eighty leading experts in the field this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex situ conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and

alaska is state on the northwest extremity of the country west coast just across the bering strait from asia an exclave of the it borders the canadian province of british columbia and territory of yukon to the east and southeast and has maritime border with russia chukotka autonomous okrug to the west to the north are the chukchi and beaufort seas of the arctic ocean while the pacific ocean lies to the south and southwest alaska is by far the largest state by area comprising more total area than the next three largest states texas california and montana combined and the seventh largest subnational division in the world it is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state but by far the continent most populous territory located mostly north of the th parallel with an estimated population of as of more than quadruple the combined populations of northern canada and greenland approximately half of alaska residents live within the anchorage metropolitan area the state capital of juneau is the second largest city in the united states by area comprising more territory than the states of rhode island and delaware alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of europeans the state is considered the entry point for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge the russians were the first europeans to settle the area beginning in the th century eventually establishing russian america which spanned most of the current state the expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the in for us million or approximately two cents per acre km the area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as territory on may it was admitted as the th state of the on january while it has one of the smallest state economies in the country alaska per capita income is among the highest owing to diversified economy dominated by fishing natural gas and oil all of which it has in abundance united states armed forces bases and tourism are also significant part of the economy more than half the state is federally owned public land including multitude of national forests parks and wildlife refuges alaska indigenous population is proportionally the highest of any state at over percent close to two dozen native languages are spoken and alaskan natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics etymology the name alaska was introduced in the russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the alaska peninsula it was derived from an aleut language idiom which figuratively refers to the mainland literally it means object to which the action of the sea is directed geography alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states and has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere alaska is the only non contiguous state on continental north america about of british columbia canada separates alaska from washington it is technically part of the continental but is sometimes not included in colloquial use alaska is not part of the contiguous often called the lower the capital city juneau is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system the state is bordered by canada yukon and british columbia to the east making it the only state to border canadian territory the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south and southwest the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the arctic ocean to the north alaska territorial waters touch russia territorial waters in the bering strait as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only apart alaska has longer coastline than all the other states combined contiguous states albers equal area conic projection at in area alaska is by far the largest state in the united states and is more than twice the size of the second largest state texas alaska is the seventh largest sub national division in the world and if it was an independent nation would be the th largest country in the world regions there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska but there are six widely accepted regions south central the most populous region of alaska containing anchorage the matanuska susitna valley and the kenai peninsula rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez southeast also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states as such this was where most of the initial non indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest the largest national forest in the united states it contains the state capital juneau the former capital sitka and ketchikan at one time alaska largest city the alaska marine highway provides vital surface transportation link throughout the area as only three communities haines hyder and skagway enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system interior denali is the highest peak in north america the interior is the largest region of alaska much of it is uninhabited wilderness fairbanks is the only large city in the region denali national park and preserve is located here denali formerly mount mckinley is the highest mountain in north america southwest grizzly bear fishing for salmon at brooks falls part of katmai national park and preserve southwest alaska is sparsely inhabited region stretching some inland from the bering sea most of the population lives along the coast kodiak island is also located in southwest the massive yukon kuskokwim delta one of the largest river deltas in the world is here portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands see below north slope the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum reserve alaska and the prudhoe bay oil field the city of utqiagvik formerly known as barrow is the northernmost city in the united states and is located here the northwest arctic area anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley is often regarded as being part of this region however the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people aleutian islands more than small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches more than into the pacific ocean some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere but the international date line was drawn west of to keep the whole state and thus the entire north american continent within the same legal day two of the islands attu and kiska were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii natural features augustine volcano erupting on january with its myriad islands alaska has nearly of tidal shoreline the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions unimak island for example is home to mount shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to above the north pacific it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth even more symmetrical than japan mount fuji the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest which is actively undergoing continent building one of the world largest tides occurs in turnagain arm just south of anchorage where tidal differences can be more than alaska has more than three million lakes marshlands and wetland permafrost cover mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands glacier ice covers about of alaska the bering glacier is the largest glacier in north america covering alone land ownership alaska has more public land owned by the federal government than any other state according to an october report by the united states bureau of land management approximately of alaska is owned and managed by the federal government as public lands including multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuges of these the bureau of land management manages or of the state the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service it is the world largest wildlife refuge comprising of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns its entitlement under the alaska statehood act portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading related opportunities these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations the university of alaska as land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently another are owned by regional and scores of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa of regional native corporation doyon limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in were repealed before they could take effect effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases privilege denied to individual alaskans but cannot sell the land individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market however various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state alaska is by large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded climate köppen climate types of alaska climate zones of alaska the climate in southeast alaska is mid latitude oceanic climate köppen climate classification cfb in the southern sections and subarctic oceanic climate köppen cfc in the northern parts on an annual basis southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year juneau averages over of precipitation year and ketchikan averages over this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months the climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the region proximity to the seacoast while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer on average anchorage receives of precipitation year with around of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow it is subarctic climate köppen dfc due to its brief cool summers the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska it is subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and continental subarctic climate farther north the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is this region has tremendous amount of variety in precipitation an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley the region around kotzebue sound is technically desert with portions receiving less than of precipitation annually on the other extreme some locations between dillingham and bethel average around of precipitation the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks the summers may have temperatures reaching into the the low to mid while in the winter the temperature can fall below precipitation is sparse in the interior often less than year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior the highest is in fort yukon which

alaska remains of six week old infant were found the baby dna showed that she belonged to population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the new world at the end of the pleistocene ben potter the university of alaska fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the upward river sun site in named this new group ancient beringians the tlingit people developed society with matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska along with parts of british columbia and the yukon also in southeast were the haida now well known for their unique arts the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in when president grover cleveland and later the congress granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla all three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late th through the mid th century with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the and resulting in high fatalities and social disruption the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut people seafaring society although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by the russians western and southwestern alaska are home to the yup ik while their cousins the alutiiq sugpiaq lived in what is now southcentral alaska the gwich in people of the northern interior region are athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much contested arctic national wildlife refuge the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people photograph of nowadluk nowadlook nora ootenna wearing parka with fur lined hood ootenna was an inupiat woman colonization map of russian america in some researchers believe the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the th century according to this hypothesis in several koches of semyon dezhnyov expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in and who had reported on village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st gabriel under the authority of the surveyor gvozdev and assistant navigator fyodorov on august during an expedition of siberian cossack shestakov and russian explorer dmitry pavlutsky another european contact with alaska occurred in when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the st peter after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands the first permanent european settlement was founded in kodiak town kodiak island between and spain sent several expeditions to alaska to assert its claim over the pacific northwest in spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez bucareli sound and cordova later the russian american company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early to mid th century sitka renamed new archangel from to on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska became the capital of russian america it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states the russians never fully colonized alaska and the colony was never very profitable evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast alaska william seward the united states secretary of state negotiated the alaska purchase also known as seward folly with the russians in for million russia contemporary ruler tsar alexander ii the emperor of the russian empire king of poland and grand duke of finland also planned the sale the purchase was made on march six months later the commissioners arrived in sitka and the formal transfer was arranged the formal flag raising took place at fort sitka on october in the ceremony uniformed soldiers marched to the governor house at castle hill where the russian troops lowered the russian flag and the flag was raised this event is celebrated as alaska day legal holiday on october alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as district starting in with governor appointed by the president of the united states federal district court was headquartered in sitka miners and prospectors climb the chilkoot trail during the klondike gold rush for most of alaska first decade under the united states flag sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers they organized provisional city government which was alaska first municipal government but not in legal sense legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in alaska as an incorporated territory starting in the and stretching in some places to the early gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in alaska capital which had been in sitka until was moved north to juneau construction of the alaska governor mansion began that

united states navy personnel were killed at attu and kiska respectively and nearly total of aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in japan about half of the aleuts died during the period of internment unalaska dutch harbor and adak became significant bases for the united states army united states army air forces and united states navy the united states lend lease program involved flying american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and then nome soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities statehood statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as congressional delegate decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following territorial referendum in the alaska statehood committee and alaska constitutional convention would soon follow statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the congress but also within alaska statehood was approved by congress on july alaska was officially proclaimed state on january in the census bureau reported alaska population as white black and american indian and alaska native kodiak before and after the tsunami which followed the good friday earthquake in destroying much of the townsite good friday earthquake on march the massive good friday earthquake killed people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides it was the second most powerful earthquake in recorded history with moment magnitude of more than thousand times as powerful as the san francisco earthquake the time of day pm time of year spring and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in anchorage discovery of oil the discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the completion of the trans alaska pipeline system led to an oil boom royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from onward that same year not coincidentally alaska repealed its state income tax in the exxon valdez hit reef in the prince william sound spilling more than of crude oil over of coastline today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine alaska heritage resources survey the alaska heritage resources survey ahrs is restricted

russian immigrants integrate into society as result an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska alaska also has the largest quaker population by percentage of any state in there were jews in alaska for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems alaskan hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other asian religious communities including sikhs and jains in alaskan hindus established the sri ganesha temple of alaska making it the first hindu temple in alaska and the northernmost hindu temple in the world there are

th in the nation its per capita personal income for was ranking th in the nation according to study by phoenix marketing international alaska had the fifth largest number of millionaires per capita in the united states with ratio of percent the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than of the state revenues derived from petroleum extraction alaska main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab agriculture represents very small fraction of the alaskan economy agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star anchorage and kodiak island boroughs as well as kodiak federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products there is also growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging energy the trans alaska pipeline transports oil alaska most financially important export from the north slope to valdez the heat pipes in the column mounts are pertinent since they disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of permafrost alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ans and cook inlet basins but according to the energy information administration by february alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas north dakota and california prudhoe bay on alaska north slope is still the second highest yielding oil field in the united states typically producing about although by early north dakota bakken formation was producing over prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america but was much smaller than canada enormous athabasca oil sands field which by was producing about of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate the trans alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaska bituminous sub bituminous and lignite coal basins the united states geological survey estimates that there are of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well alaska economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for statewide energy systems with special low cost electric interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report due to low less than gal fuel prices long distances and low population the cost of gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors permanent fund the alaska permanent fund is authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in to manage surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed trans alaska pipeline system the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to million at once it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for particular purpose the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation from its initial principal of the fund has grown to billion as result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such stance has never gained momentum starting in dividends from the fund annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial in equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in lawsuit over the distribution scheme to in which included one time resource rebate every year the state legislature takes out from the earnings puts back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining is distributed to all qualifying alaskans to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for minimum of months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of basic income policy in the world cost of living the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous states federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and active duty military members receive cost of living allowance usually set at of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure agriculture and fishing halibut both as sport fish and commercially is important to the state economy due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska most farms are in either the matanuska valley about northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about southwest of anchorage the short day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction area about southeast of fairbanks with sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely this area was largely set aside and developed under state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor delta area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and community supported agriculture alaskan agriculture has experienced surge in growth of market gardeners small farms and farmers markets in recent years with the highest percentage increase in the nation in growth in farmers markets in compared to nationwide the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling niche in the flower market alaska with no counties lacks county fairs however small assortment of state and local fairs with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest are held mostly in the late summer the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high profile commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote bush communities an example of traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries alaska reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive although most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes the cost of transport can reach as high as per pound kg or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions the cost of delivering of milk is about in many villages where per capita income can be or less fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous united states average with only hawaii having higher prices transportation the sterling highway near its intersection with the seward highway roads the susitna river bridge on the denali highway is long alaska interstate highways alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the the state road system covers relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road only car ferry this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to city on the road system or building road connection from haines the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska alaska welcome sign on the klondike highway the interstate highways in alaska consists of total of miles one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about southeast of anchorage at portage at the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america rail an alaska railroad locomotive over bridge in girdwood approaching anchorage the white pass and yukon route traverses rugged terrain north of skagway near the canada us border built around the alaska railroad arr played key role in the development of alaska through the th century it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier palmer and north pole the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt in recent years the ever improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad importance in alaska economy the railroad played vital role in alaska development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward such as coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country stretch of about of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area until construction of the parks highway in the the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route in northern southeast alaska the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada british columbia and yukon territory crossing the border at white pass summit this line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at skagway it was featured in the bbc television series great little railways the alaska rail network is not connected to outside the nearest link to the north american railway network is the northwest terminus of the canadian national railway at prince rupert british columbia several hundred miles to the southeast in the congress authorized million to study the feasibility of rail link between alaska canada and the lower some private companies provides car float service between whittier and seattle marine transport many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea the named after tustumena glacier is one of the state many ferries providing service between the kenai peninsula kodiak island and the aleutian chain alaska well developed state owned ferry system known as the alaska marine highway serves the cities of southeast the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers the system also operates ferry service from bellingham washington and prince rupert british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway the inter island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway in recent years cruise lines have created summertime tourism market mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and to lesser degree towns along alaska gulf coast the population of ketchikan for example fluctuates dramatically on many days up to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time air transport cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for alaska extremely well developed bush air services an alaskan novelty anchorage and to lesser extent fairbanks is served by many major airlines because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism in alaska received almost two million visitors regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in state travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities bombardier dash operated by era alaska on approach to ted stevens anchorage international airport the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities many communities have small air taxi services these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas perhaps the most alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the world busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs in alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any state other transport another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times that is any time after the mid late dog mushing is more of sport than true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race trail from anchorage to nome although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at the race commemorates the famous serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much needed medicine to the diphtheria stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous relay leaving from the community of nenana southwest of fairbanks to nome in areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by all terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine as it is commonly referred to in alaska data transport alaska internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major companies gci and alaska communications gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late alaska communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower and two more across alaska in january it was reported that billion project to connect asia and rural alaska was being planned aided in part by million in stimulus from the federal government law and government state government the center of state government in juneau the large buildings in the background are from left to right the court plaza building known colloquially as the spam can the state office building behind the alaska office building the john dimond state courthouse and the alaska state capitol many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies like all other states alaska is governed as republic with three branches of government an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and his or her appointees which head executive departments legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska senate and judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts the state of alaska employs approximately people statewide the alaska legislature consists of member house of representatives and member senate senators serve four year terms and house members two the governor of alaska serves four year terms the lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries but during the general election the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket alaska court system has four levels the alaska supreme court the alaska court of appeals the superior courts and the district courts the superior and district courts are trial courts superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction while district courts hear only certain types of cases including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to the supreme court and the court of appeals are appellate courts the court of appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower court decisions including those regarding criminal prosecutions juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus the supreme court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals state politics gubernatorial election results year democratic republican although in its early years of statehood alaska was democratic state since the early it has been characterized as republican leaning local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights alaska natives while organized in and around their communities have been active within the native corporations these have been given ownership over large tracts of land which require stewardship alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one home was completely legal under state law though the

washington as the first three states where recreational marijuana is legal the new law means people over can consume small amounts of pot the first legal marijuana store opened in valdez in october taxes to finance state government operations alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies this allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the united states it is one of five states with no sales tax one of seven states with no individual income tax and along with new hampshire one of two that has neither the department of revenue tax division reports regularly on the state revenue sources the department also issues an annual summary of its operations including new state laws that directly affect the tax division in the tax foundation ranked alaska as having

levied include raw fish taxes hotel motel and bed and breakfast bed taxes severance taxes liquor and tobacco taxes gaming pull tabs taxes tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees such as petroleum aviation motor fuel telephone cooperative is shared with municipalities in alaska the fall in oil prices after the fracking boom in the early has decimated alaska state treasury which has historically received about percent of its revenue from taxes and fees imposed on oil and gas companies the state government has had to drastically reduce its budget and has brought its budget shortfall from over billion in to under million by in alaska state government budget was billion while projected government revenues were only billion federal politics line graph showing the presidential vote by party from to in alaska alaska regularly supports republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood republicans have won the state electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in no state has voted for democratic presidential candidate fewer times alaska was carried by democratic

divided into counties as most of the other states but it is divided into boroughs many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaska boroughs which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states however unlike county equivalents in the other states the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough the unorganized borough has no government of its own but the census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation recording district is mechanism for administration of the public record in alaska the state is divided into recording districts which are centrally administered under state recorder all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria fee schedule etc for accepting documents into the public record whereas many states use three tiered system

campuses in seward and anchorage offer one week to month training programs in areas as diverse as information technology welding nursing and mechanics alaska has had problem with brain drain many of its young people including most of the highest academic achievers leave the state after high school graduation and do not return alaska did not have law school or medical school the university of alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four year scholarships to the top of alaska high school graduates via the alaska scholars program public health and public safety the alaska state troopers are alaska statewide police force they have long and storied history but were not an official organization until before the force was officially organized law enforcement in alaska was handled by various federal agencies larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on public safety officers who have police training but do not carry firearms in much of the state the troopers serve as the only police force available in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the troopers duties they employ wide variety of land air and water patrol vehicles many rural communities in alaska are considered dry having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state this is in part linked to alcohol abuse alaska has the

harvesting wheat with combine harvester accompanied by tractor and trailer agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities the history of agriculture began thousands of years ago after gathering wild grains beginning at least years ago nascent farmers began to plant them around years ago pigs sheep and cattle were domesticated over years ago plants were independently cultivated in at least regions of the world industrial agriculture based on large scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output though about billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty first modern agronomy plant breeding agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological developments have sharply increased yields while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage environmental issues include contributions to global warming depletion of aquifers deforestation antibiotic resistance and growth hormones in industrial meat production genetically modified organisms are widely used although some are banned in certain countries the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials such as rubber food classes include cereals grains vegetables fruits oils meat milk fungi and eggs over one third of the world workers are employed in agriculture second only to the service sector although the number of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the centuries etymology and scope the word agriculture is late middle english adaptation of latin agricultūra from ager field and cultūra cultivation or growing while agriculture usually refers to human activities certain species of ant termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to million years agriculture is defined with varying scopes in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life including food fiber forest products horticultural crops and their related services thus defined it includes arable farming horticulture animal husbandry and forestry but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded history origins centres of origin as numbered by nikolai vavilov in the area gray is no longer recognised as centre of origin and papua new guinea area orange was identified more recently the development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included diverse range of taxa in at least separate centres of origin wild grains were collected and eaten from at least years ago from around years ago the eight neolithic founder crops emmer and einkorn wheat hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax were cultivated in the levant rice was domesticated in china between and bc with the earliest known cultivation from bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between and years ago cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some years ago pig production emerged in eurasia including europe east asia and southwest asia where wild boar were first domesticated about years ago in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between and years ago along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around years ago sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by years ago cotton was domesticated in peru by years ago and was independently domesticated in eurasia in mesoamerica wild teosinte was bred into maize by years ago scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture studies of the transition from hunter gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in the levant and the early chinese neolithic in china then wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted and gradually came to be domesticated civilizations agricultural scenes of threshing grain store harvesting with sickles digging tree cutting and ploughing from ancient egypt tomb of nakht th century bc in eurasia the sumerians started to live in villages from about bc relying on the tigris and euphrates rivers and canal system for irrigation ploughs appear in pictographs around bc seed ploughs around bc farmers grew wheat barley vegetables such as lentils and onions and fruits including dates grapes and figs ancient egyptian agriculture relied on the nile river and its seasonal flooding farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the paleolithic after bc staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus in india wheat barley and jujube were domesticated by bc soon followed by sheep and goats cattle sheep and goats were domesticated in mehrgarh culture by bc cotton was cultivated by the th th millennium bc archeological evidence indicates an animal drawn plough from bc in the indus valley civilisation in china from the th century bc there was nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming water powered grain mills were in use by the st century bc followed by irrigation by the late nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards these spread westwards across eurasia asian rice was domesticated years ago depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used on the pearl river in southern china with single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon in greece and rome the major cereals were wheat emmer and barley alongside vegetables including peas beans and olives sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products in the americas crops domesticated in mesoamerica apart from teosinte include squash beans and cocoa cocoa was being domesticated by the mayo chinchipe of the upper amazon around bc the turkey was probably domesticated in mexico or the american southwest the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides fertilized their soil and developed chinampas or artificial islands the mayas used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from bc coca was domesticated in the andes as were the peanut tomato tobacco and pineapple cotton was domesticated in peru by bc animals including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs were domesticated there in north america the indigenous people of the east domesticated crops such as sunflower tobacco squash and chenopodium wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested the domesticated strawberry is hybrid of chilean and north american species developed by breeding in europe and north america the indigenous people of the southwest and the pacific northwest practiced forest gardening and fire stick farming the natives controlled fire on regional scale to create low intensity fire ecology that sustained low density agriculture in loose rotation sort of wild permaculture system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed on the great plains the three crops were winter squash maize and climbing beans indigenous australians long supposed to have been nomadic hunter gatherers practised systematic burning to enhance natural productivity in fire stick farming the gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some years ago there is evidence of intensification across the whole continent over that period in two regions of australia the central west coast and eastern central early farmers cultivated yams native millet and bush onions possibly in permanent settlements revolution the arab agricultural revolution starting in al andalus islamic spain transformed agriculture with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants in the middle ages both in the islamic world and in europe agriculture transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of al andalus after the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes tomatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers advanced from the th century with the british agricultural revolution allowing global population to rise significantly since agriculture in developed nations and to lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding the haber bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining further increase in global population modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological political and economic issues including water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and farm subsidies leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement types reindeer herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several arctic and subarctic peoples pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals in nomadic pastoralism herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture fodder and water this type of farming is practised in arid and semi arid regions of sahara central asia and some parts of india in shifting cultivation small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees the cleared land is used for growing crops for few years until the soil becomes too infertile and the area is abandoned another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly this practice is used in northeast india southeast asia and the amazon basin spreading manure by hand in zambia subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone with little left over for transport elsewhere it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and south east asia an estimated billion subsistence farmers worked in cultivating about of the earth arable land intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity with low fallow ratio and high use of inputs water fertilizer pesticide and automation it is practiced mainly in developed countries contemporary agriculture status china has the largest agricultural output of any country from the twentieth century intensive agriculture increased productivity it substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor but caused increased water pollution and often involved farm subsidies in recent years there has been backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic regenerative and sustainable agriculture movements one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union which first certified organic food in and began reform of its common agricultural policy cap in to phase out commodity linked farm subsidies also known as decoupling the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management selective breeding and controlled environment agriculture recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food demand for non food biofuel crops development of former farm lands rising transportation costs climate change growing consumer demand in china and india and population growth are threatening food security in many parts of the world the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security given the favorable experience of vietnam soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally approximately of the world agricultural land is seriously degraded by the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world followed by the european union india and the united states economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the united states is roughly times more productive than it was in workforce on the three sector theory the proportion of people working in agriculture left hard bar in each group green falls as an economy becomes more developed following the three sector theory the number of people employed in agriculture and other primary activities such as fishing can be more than in the least developed countries and less than in the most highly developed countries since the industrial revolution many countries have made the transition to developed economies and the proportion of people working in agriculture has steadily fallen during the th century in europe for example between and of the population was engaged in agriculture by the th century this had dropped to between and in the same countries today the figure is less than at the start of the st century some one billion people or over of the available work force were employed in agriculture it constitutes approximately of the global employment of children and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry the service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in safety rollover protection bar retrofitted to mid th century fordson tractor agriculture specifically farming remains hazardous industry and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work related injuries lung disease noise induced hearing loss skin diseases as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure on industrialized farms injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery and common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself entire families can be at risk for injuries illness and death ages may be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning machinery and motor accidents including with all terrain vehicles the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors it estimates that the annual work related death toll among agricultural employees is at least twice the average rate of other jobs in addition incidences of death injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play in the united states agriculture has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health as priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues in the european union the european agency for safety and health at work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture livestock farming horticulture and forestry the agricultural safety and health council of america ashca also holds yearly summit to discuss safety production value of agricultural production overall production varies by country as listed largest countries by agricultural output in nominal terms according to imf and cia world factbook at peak level as of largest countries by agricultural output according to unctad at constant prices and exchange rates crop cultivation systems slash and burn shifting cultivation thailand cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer shifting cultivation or slash and burn is system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for period of several years then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to new plot returning after many more years this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs intercropping of coconut and mexican marigold further led to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on large acreage because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in year or requiring irrigation in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system important categories of food crops include cereals legumes forage fruits and vegetables natural fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world production is listed in millions of metric tons based on fao estimates top agricultural products by crop types

by individual crops million tonnes data sugar cane maize rice wheat potatoes sugar beet soybeans cassava tomatoes barley source food and agriculture organization livestock production systems intensively farmed pigs animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat milk eggs or wool and for work and transport working animals including horses mules oxen water buffalo camels llamas alpacas donkeys and dogs have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grassland based mixed and landless of earth ice and water free area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately billion people between the and the there was significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost factor of non meat animals such as milk cows and egg producing chickens also showed significant production increases global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of year between and during the second half of the th century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity this trend has led to significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds raising chickens intensively for meat in broiler house grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as major nutrient source this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing million pastoralists mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as fertilizer for crops landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the de linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic co operation and development member countries synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes challenge as well as source for pollution industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork scientists estimate that of the growth in livestock production between and will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia with much smaller amounts of growth in africa some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormones are controversial production practices tilling an arable field tractor and horsepower plowing in nurmijärvi finland in tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting for nutrient incorporation or for pest control tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no till it may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases chemical pesticides biological biocontrol mechanical tillage and cultural practices are used cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crops intercropping composting avoidance and resistance integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as last resort nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and minerals crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or fallow period manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures center pivot irrigation system water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall in other areas such as the great plains in the and canada farmers use fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing crop in the following year agriculture represents of freshwater use worldwide according to report by the international food policy research institute agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as and food prices could be reduced by almost half payment for ecosystem services is method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of city to improve the supply of fresh water crop alteration and biotechnology plant breeding wheat cultivar tolerant of high salinity left compared with non tolerant variety crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make up of plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds drought tolerance or resistance to pests significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel his work on dominant and recessive alleles although initially largely ignored for almost years gave plant breeders better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits self pollination and cross pollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants plant selection and breeding in the and improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand extensive ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts primitive genetic engineering during the produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating high yielding varieties for example average yields of corn maize in the us have increased from around tons per hectare ha bushels per acre in to about ha bushels per acre in similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than ha in to more than ha in south american average wheat yields are around ha african under ha and egypt and arabia up to to ha with irrigation in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over ha variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging genetic engineering genetically modified potato plants left resist virus diseases that damage unmodified plants right genetically modified organisms gmo are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering for some gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of gmo foods and crops currently global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled the us does not herbicide resistant seed has gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosate these seeds allow the farmer to grow crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop herbicide tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide with the increasing use of herbicide tolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosate based herbicide sprays in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both crop production and nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications other gmo crops used by growers include insect resistant crops which have gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces toxin specific to insects these crops resist damage by insects some believe that similar or better pest resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross pollination with wild species in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes environmental impact effects and costs water pollution in rural stream due to runoff from farming activity in new zealand agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature especially herbicides and insecticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage and loss of natural environment assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for of million or per hectare analysis of these costs in the us concluded that cropland imposes approximately to billion to per hectare while livestock production imposes million both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens predators and competitors such as weeds costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units such as making fields larger this means removing hedges ditches and other areas of habitat pesticides kill insects plants and fungi these and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land in the international resource panel of the united nations environment programme assessed the environmental impacts of consumption and production it found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment including insecticides especially those used on cotton the unep green economy report states that aagricultural operations excluding land use changes produce approximately per cent of anthropogenic global ghg emissions this includes ghgs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilizers agro chemical pesticides and herbicides ghg emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions and fossil fuel energy inputs on average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second generation biofuel production amounts to billion tonnes per year between and with an average annual growth rate of per cent throughout the period analysed accounting for higher growth during early years per cent for and an average per cent annual expansion after livestock issues farmyard anaerobic digester converts waste plant material and manure from livestock into biogas fuel senior un official henning steinfeld said that livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today most serious environmental problems livestock production occupies of all land used for agriculture or of the land surface of the planet it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for of the world greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co equivalents by comparison all transportation emits of the co it produces of human related nitrous oxide which has times the global warming potential of co and of all human induced methane which is times as warming as co it also generates of the ammonia emission livestock expansion is cited as key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity furthermore the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by per cent by under current practices and consumption patterns land and water issues circular irrigated crop fields in kansas healthy growing crops of corn and sorghum are green sorghum may be slightly paler wheat is brilliant gold fields of brown have been recently harvested and plowed or have lain in fallow for the year land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earth ecosystems and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from to land degradation the long term decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented the un fao report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that billion people rely upon the degrading land degradation can be deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion or chemical degradation acidification and salinization agriculture lead to rise in zoonotic disease like the coronavirus disease by degrading natural buffers between humans and animals reducing biodiversity and creating big groups of genetically similar animals eutrophication excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal bloom and anoxia leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and leaching from agricultural land these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater with harmful effects on human populations fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients agriculture accounts for percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources agriculture is major draw on water from aquifers and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran mexico and saudi arabia increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world growing population with reduced water resources agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems including the destruction of natural wetlands the spread of water borne diseases and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging when irrigation is performed incorrectly pesticides spraying crop with pesticide pesticide use has increased since to million short tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant the world health organization estimated in that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing deaths pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of new pesticide an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming view exemplified by quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature however critics argue that trade off between the environment and need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation the push pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping using plant aromas to repel pests from crops push and to lure them to place from which they can then be removed pull climate change winnowing grain global warming will probably harm crop yields in low latitude countries like ethiopia climate change and agriculture are interrelated on global scale global warming affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures rainfall and weather extremes like storms and heat waves changes in pests and diseases changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground level ozone concentrations changes in the nutritional quality of some foods and changes in sea level global warming is already affecting agriculture with effects unevenly distributed across the world future climate change will probably negatively affect crop production in low latitude countries while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative global warming will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups such as the poor animal husbandry is also responsible for greenhouse gas production of and percentage of the world methane and future land infertility and the displacement of wildlife agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and by the conversion of non agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use agriculture forestry and land use change contributed around to to global annual emissions in range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector sustainability terraces conservation tillage and conservation buffers reduce soil erosion and water pollution on this farm in iowa current farming methods have resulted in over stretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how critical water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered solution would be to give value to ecosystems recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balancing the rights of variety of users and interests inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland or the preservation of wetland system that limits fishing rights technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable technology permits innovations like conservation tillage farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion reduces water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration other potential practices include conservation agriculture agroforestry improved grazing avoided grassland conversion and biochar current mono crop farming practices in the united states preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices such as crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy according to report by the international food policy research institute ifpri agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by ifpri found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as and food prices could be reduced by almost half the caloric demand of earth projected population with current climate change predictions can be satisfied by additional improvement of agricultural methods expansion of agricultural areas and sustainability oriented consumer mindset energy dependence mechanised agriculture from the first models in the tools like cotton picker could replace farm workers at the price of increased use of fossil fuel since the agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energy intensive mechanization fertilizers and pesticides the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources between the and the the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly between and for wheat and to for rice depending on geographic area as world population doubled heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery agriculture and food system share of total by three industrialized nations country year agriculture direct indirect foodsystem united kingdom united states sweden indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers pesticides and farm machinery in particular the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage together direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about of the nation energy use direct and indirect energy consumption by farms peaked in and has since gradually declined food systems encompass not just agriculture but off farm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and food related items agriculture accounts for less than one fifth of food system energy use in the us disciplines agricultural economics agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as discipline of study began in the late and grew significantly through the th century although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post american civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of manorialism in the united states and elsewhere food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing sometimes referred to as the value chain have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition more highly processed products provided by the supply chain market concentration has increased in the sector as well and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities in th century britain the protectionist corn laws led to high prices and widespread protest such as this meeting of the anti corn law league national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products in the form of taxation subsidies tariffs and other measures since at least the combination of trade restrictions exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world in the non subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products between the mid and the early several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions however there was still significant amount of policy driven distortion in global agricultural product prices the three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation among the oilseeds sesame had the greatest amount of taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products since the policy driven distortions have seen greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with non subsidized farmers unprocessed commodities such as corn soybeans and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality affecting the price the producer receives commodities are generally reported by production quantities such as volume number or weight agricultural science agronomist mapping plant genome agricultural science is broad field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture it covers topics such as agronomy plant breeding and genetics plant pathology crop modelling soil science entomology production techniques and improvement study of pests and their management and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation waste management and bioremediation the scientific study of agriculture began in the th century when johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum hydrated calcium sulphate as fertilizer research became more systematic when in john lawes and henry gilbert began set of long term agronomy field experiments at rothamsted research station in england some of them such as the park grass experiment are still running in america the hatch act of provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science driven by farmers interest in fertilizers in agricultural entomology the usda began to research biological control in it instituted its first large program in searching europe and japan for natural enemies of the gypsy moth and brown tail moth establishing parasitoids such as solitary wasps and predators of both pests in the usa policy direct subsidies for animal products and feed by oecd countries in in billions of us dollars product subsidy beef and veal milk pigs poultry soybeans eggs sheep agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment including policies related to climate change food safety and natural disasters economic stability including policies related to taxes natural resources and environmental sustainability especially water policy research and development and market access for domestic commodities including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries agricultural policy can also touch on food quality ensuring that the food supply is of consistent and known quality food security ensuring that the food supply meets the population needs and conservation policy programs can range from financial programs such as subsidies to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy including consumers agribusiness trade lobbies and other groups agribusiness interests hold large amount of influence over policy making in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions political action groups including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions also provide influence as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements dr samuel jutzi director of fao animal production and health division states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment for example proposals in for voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health

introduction to krishnamurti quintessential statement the first and last freedom huxley also became vedantist in the circle of hindu swami prabhavananda and introduced christopher isherwood to this circle not long afterwards huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world huxley book affirmed

sexual and economic foundations of new society on october huxley wrote to george orwell author of nineteen eighty four congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is in his letter to orwell he predicted huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself from these he made some warnings in his writings and talks in televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation the tendency towards distinctly hierarchical social organisation the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion the tendency to promote modern politicians to naive public as well marketed commodities in the fall semester of huxley was invited by professor huston smith to be the carnegie visiting professor of humanities at the massachusetts institute of technology mit as part of the mit centennial program of events organised by the department of humanities huxley presented series of lectures titled what piece of work is man which concerned history language and art post world war ii life in huxley and maria applied for united states citizenship and presented themselves for examination when huxley refused to bear arms for the and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals the only excuse allowed under the mccarran act the judge had to adjourn the proceedings he withdrew his application nevertheless he remained in the in huxley turned down an offer of

by the society he also served on the editorial board with isherwood heard and playwright john van druten from through huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples two of those lectures have been released on cd knowledge and understanding and who are we from nonetheless huxley agnosticism together with his speculative propensity made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of religion psychedelic drug use and mystical experiences in the spring of huxley had his first experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline huxley had initiated correspondence with doctor humphry osmond british psychiatrist then employed in canadian institution and eventually asked him to supply dose of mescaline osmond obliged and supervised huxley session in southern california after the publication of the doors of perception in which he recounted this experience huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but huxley continued to write articles for the society journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions huxley later had an experience on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in the doors of perception huxley wrote that the mystical experience is doubly valuable it is valuable because it gives the experiencer better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead less self centered and more creative life eyesight huxley in his right eye affected by keratitis he contracted in differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of huxley eyesight at specific points in his life circa huxley encountered the bates method in which he was instructed by margaret darst corbett in huxley relocated from hollywood to ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northern los angeles county huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert he reported that for the first time in more than years he was able to read without glasses and without strain he even tried driving car along the dirt road beside the ranch he wrote book about his experiences with the bates method the art of seeing which was published in uk the book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created growing degree of popular controversy about huxley eyesight it was and is widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford for example some ten years after publication of the art of seeing in bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty then suddenly he faltered and the disturbing truth became obvious he wasn reading his address at all he had learned it by heart to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes when it was only an inch or so away he still couldn read it and had to fish for magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him it was an agonising moment brazilian author joão ubaldo ribeiro who as young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys company in the late wrote that huxley had said to him with wry smile can hardly see at all and don give damn really on the other hand huxley second wife laura archera later emphasised in her biographical account this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight after revealing letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as poor fellow who can hardly see by walter alvarez she tempered her statement with although feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision for instance although aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use magnifying lens laura huxley proceeded to elaborate few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxley vision her account in this respect agrees with the following sample of huxley own words from the art of seeing the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable nevertheless the topic of huxley eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversy american popular science author steven johnson in his book mind wide open quotes huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding am and for as long as can remember have always been poor visualizer words even the pregnant words of poets do not evoke pictures in my mind no hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep when recall something the memory does not present itself to me as vividly seen event or object by an effort of the will can evoke not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon personal life huxley married maria nys september february belgian he met at garsington oxfordshire in they had one child matthew huxley april february who had career as an author anthropologist and prominent epidemiologist in maria huxley died of cancer in huxley married laura archera also an author as well as violinist and psychotherapist she wrote this timeless moment biography of huxley she told the story of their marriage through mary ann braubach documentary huxley on huxley huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the utopian novel island and gave lectures on human potentialities both at the ucsf medical center and at the esalen institute these lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the human potential movement huxley was close friend of jiddu krishnamurti and rosalind rajagopal and was involved in the creation of the happy valley school now besant hill school of happy valley in ojai california the most substantial collection of huxley few remaining papers following the destruction of most in fire is at the library of the university of california los angeles some are also at the stanford university libraries on april huxley was informed he was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature the senior literary organisation in britain and he accepted the title via letter on april the correspondence between huxley and the society is kept at the cambridge university library the society invited huxley to appear at banquet and give lecture at somerset house london in june huxley wrote draft of the speech he intended to give at the society however his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend death on his deathbed unable to speak owing to advanced laryngeal cancer huxley made written request to his wife laura for lsd µg intramuscular according to her account of his death in this timeless moment she obliged with an injection at and second dose an hour later huxley died aged at los angeles time on november media coverage of huxley death along with that of fellow british author lewis was overshadowed by the assassination of american president john kennedy on the same day less than seven hours before huxley death in an article for new york magazine titled the eclipsed celebrity death club christopher bonanos wrote this coincidence served as the basis for peter kreeft book between heaven and hell dialog somewhere beyond death with john kennedy lewis aldous huxley which imagines conversation among the three men taking place in purgatory following their deaths huxley memorial service took place in london in december it was led by his elder brother julian on october his ashes

algae singular alga is an informal term for large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms it is polyphyletic grouping including species from multiple distinct clades included organisms range from unicellular microalgae such as chlorella and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp large brown alga which may grow up to in length most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem which are found in land plants the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta division of green algae which includes for example spirogyra and stoneworts no definition of algae is generally accepted one definition is that algae have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells although cyanobacteria are often referred to as blue green algae most authorities exclude all prokaryotes from the definition of algae algae constitute polyphyletic group since they do not include common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga algae exhibit wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids leaf like structures of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs found in tracheophytes vascular plants most are phototrophic although some are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs also called colorless or apochlorotic algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as by product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to to billion years ago etymology and study the singular is the latin word for seaweed and retains that meaning in english the etymology is obscure although some speculate that it is related to latin be cold no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature more likely source is binding entwining the ancient greek word for seaweed was which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or red dye derived from it the latinization meant primarily the cosmetic rouge the etymology is uncertain but strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical paint if not that word itself cosmetic eye shadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean it could be any color black red green or blue accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the greek or latin root is used the name fucus appears in number of taxa classifications the committee on the international code of botanical nomenclature has recommended certain suffixes for use in the classification of algae these are phyta for division phyceae for class phycideae for subclass ales for order inales for suborder aceae for family oidease for subfamily greek based name for genus and latin based name for species algal characteristics basic to primary classification the primary classification of algae is based on certain morphological features the chief among these are pigment constitution of the cell chemical nature of stored food materials kind number point of insertion and relative length of the flagella on the motile cell chemical composition of cell wall and presence or absence of definitely organized nucleus in the cell or any other significant details of cell structure history of classification of algae although carolus linnaeus included algae along with lichens in his th class cryptogamia he did not elaborate further on the classification of algae jean pierre étienne vaucher was perhaps the first to propose system of classification of algae and he recognized three groups conferves ulves and tremelles while johann heinrich friedrich link classified algae on the basis of the colour of the pigment and structure william henry harvey proposed system of classification on the basis of the habitat and the pigment agardh divided algae into six orders diatomaceae nostochineae confervoideae ulvaceae floriadeae and fucoideae around algae along with fungi were grouped under thallophyta division created by eichler encouraged by this adolf engler and karl prantl proposed revised scheme of classification of algae and included fungi in algae as they were of opinion that fungi have been derived from algae the scheme proposed by engler and prantl is summarised as follows schizophyta phytosarcodina flagellata dinoflagellata bacillariophyta conjugatae chlorophyceae charophyta phaeophyceae rhodophyceae eumycetes fungi false color scanning electron micrograph of the unicellular coccolithophore gephyrocapsa oceanica the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely phylogeny based on plastid not genealogy supergroup affiliation members endosymbiont summary primoplantae archaeplastida chlorophyta rhodophyta glaucophyta cyanobacteria these algae have primary chloroplasts the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through single endosymbiotic event the chloroplasts of red algae have chlorophylls and often and phycobilins while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll and without phycobilins land plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them thus the chlorophyta is sister taxon to the plants sometimes the chlorophyta the charophyta and land plants are grouped together as the viridiplantae excavata and rhizaria euglenids green algae these groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls and their chloroplasts are surrounded by four and three membranes respectively and were probably retained from ingested green algae which belong to the phylum cercozoa contain small nucleomorph which is relict of the algae nucleus euglenids which belong to the phylum euglenozoa live primarily in fresh water and have chloroplasts with only three membranes the endosymbiotic green algae may have been acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis chromista and alveolata heterokonts haptophyta cryptomonads dinoflagellates red algae these groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls and and phycobilins the shape varies from plant to plant they may be of discoid plate like reticulate cup shaped spiral or ribbon shaped they have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic similarities with red algae suggest relationship there in the first three of these groups chromista the chloroplast has four membranes retaining nucleomorph in cryptomonads and they likely share common pigmented ancestor although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts haptophyta and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group and number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred the apicomplexa group of closely related parasites also have plastids called apicoplasts which are not photosynthetic but appear to have common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts gmelin historia fucorum dated linnaeus in species plantarum the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized genera of algae of which only four are currently considered among algae in systema naturae linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina and species of acetabularia as madrepora among the animals in samuel gottlieb gmelin published the historia fucorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves harvey and lamouroux were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation this is the first use of biochemical criterion in plant systematics harvey four divisions are red algae rhodospermae brown algae melanospermae green algae chlorospermae and diatomaceae at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by different group of workers müller and ehrenberg studying the infusoria microscopic organisms unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile even the nonmotile coccoid microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants macroalgae or animals although used as taxonomic category in some pre darwinian classifications linnaeus de jussieu horaninow agassiz wilson cassin in further classifications the algae are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group throughout the th century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae cyanophytes rhodophytes chrysophytes xanthophytes phaeophytes pyrrhophytes cryptophytes and dinophytes euglenophytes and chlorophytes later many new groups were discovered bolidophyceae and others were splintered from older groups charophytes and glaucophytes from chlorophytes many synurophytes from chrysophytes or from xanthophytes haptophytes from chrysophytes and from xanthophytes with the abandonment of plant animal dichotomous classification most groups of algae sometimes all were included in protista later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota however as legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications see ambiregnal protists some parasitic algae the green algae prototheca and helicosporidium parasites of metazoans or cephaleuros parasites of plants were originally classified as fungi sporozoans or protistans of incertae sedis while others the green algae phyllosiphon and rhodochytrium parasites of plants or the red algae and gelidiocolax mammillatus parasites of other red algae or the dinoflagellates oodinium parasites of fish had their relationship with algae conjectured early in other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae chlorochytrium but later were seen as endophytic algae some filamentous bacteria beggiatoa were originally seen as algae furthermore groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae relationship to land plants the first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like chara almost million years ago these probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as million years ago morphology the kelp forest exhibit at the monterey bay aquarium three dimensional multicellular thallus range of algal morphologies is exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common the only groups to exhibit three dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode stems whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait they appear in the coralline algae and the as well as the browns most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the lifecycle of species are colonial small regular groups of motile cells capsoid individual non motile cells embedded in mucilage coccoid individual non motile cells with cell walls palmelloid nonmotile cells embedded in mucilage filamentous string of nonmotile cells connected together sometimes branching parenchymatous cells forming thallus with partial differentiation of tissues in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation these are the brown algae some of which may reach in length kelps the red algae and the green algae the most complex forms are found among the charophyte algae see charales and charophyta in lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants the innovation that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo hence the land plants are referred to as the embryophytes physiology many algae particularly members of the characeae have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials phytohormones are found not only in higher plants but in algae too symbiotic algae some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae examples are lichens rock lichens in ireland lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be an association of fungus and photosynthetic symbiont resulting in stable vegetative body having specific structure the fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the ascomycota with few from the basidiomycota in nature they do not occur separate from lichens it is unknown when they began to associate one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with species of cyanobacteria hence photobiont is the more accurate term photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species the association is termed morphogenesis because the lichen has form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone they can be experimentally isolated the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont trentepohlia is an example of common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichenised lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae aerophytes growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them coral reefs floridian coral reef coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order scleractinia stony corals these animals metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell building processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts dinoflagellates algal protists are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral forming marine invertebrates where they accelerate host cell metabolism by generating sugar and oxygen immediately available through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host reef building stony corals hermatypic corals require endosymbiotic algae from the genus symbiodinium to be in healthy condition the loss of symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching condition which leads to the deterioration of reef sea sponges endosymbiontic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponges halichondria panicea the alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for to of sponge growth in some species lifecycle rhodophyta chlorophyta and the three main algal divisions have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity in general an asexual phase exists where the seaweed cells are diploid sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible commonly in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form zygote to ensure successful mating the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated pheromones may play key role in these processes sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of dna damages during meiosis key stage of the sexual cycle however sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae numbers shihtiping in taiwan the algal collection of the us national herbarium located in the national museum of natural history consists of approximately dried specimens which although not exhaustive no exhaustive collection exists gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species that number remains unknown estimates vary widely for example according to one standard textbook in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be algal species in the uk another checklist reports only about species regarding the difference of about species the text concludes it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide reliable estimate of the total number of species regional and group estimates have been made as well species of red algae worldwide some in australian seas seaweed species for the western coastline of south africa and species from the coast of kwazulu natal some of these are duplicates as the range extends across both coasts and the total recorded is probably about species most of these are listed in list of seaweeds of south africa these exclude phytoplankton and crustose corallines marine species from california us in the check list of britain and ireland and so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton the most recent estimate suggests algal species worldwide distribution the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid th century algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores this dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms due to this spores can be found in variety of environments fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms whether spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers however not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them marine spores are often spread by ocean currents ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as pacific algae or north sea algae when they occur out of their localities hypothesizing transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships for example ulva reticulata and fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns for example clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there however scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies ecology phytoplankton lake chūzenji algae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and ice seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under deep however some such as navicula pennata have been recorded to depth of type of algae ancylonema nordenskioeldii was found in greenland in areas known as the dark zone which caused an increase in the rate of melting ice sheet same algae was found in the italian alps after pink ice appeared on parts of the presena glacier the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chains in very high densities algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life forms algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems in many cases algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants due to this the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants to detect these changes algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease on the basis of their habitat algae can be categorized as aquatic planktonic benthic marine freshwater lentic lotic terrestrial aerial subaerial lithophytic halophytic or euryhaline psammon thermophilic cryophilic epibiont epiphytic epizoic endosymbiont endophytic endozoic parasitic calcifilic or lichenic phycobiont cultural associations in classical chinese the word is used both for algae and in the modest tradition of the imperial scholars for literary talent the third island in kunming lake beside the summer palace in beijing is known as the zaojian tang dao which thus simultaneously means island of the algae viewing

fertilized gardens on inisheer for centuries seaweed has been used as fertilizer george owen of henllys writing in the th century referring to drift weed in south wales today algae are used by humans

use of large amounts of toxic chemicals that would otherwise be needed algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms when subsequently harvested the enriched algae can be used as

scientists found that of nitrogen runoff and of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turf scrubber ats scientists developed the ats which consists of shallow foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans researchers collected and dried the nutrient rich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers algae scrubbers using bubbling upflow or

analysis of variance anova is collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures such as the variation among and between groups used to analyze the differences among group means in sample anova was developed by the statistician ronald fisher the anova is based on the law of total variance where the observed variance in particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation in its simplest form anova provides statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal and therefore generalizes the test beyond two means history while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the th century antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler these include hypothesis testing the partitioning of sums of squares experimental techniques and the additive model laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the around laplace and gauss developed the least squares method for combining observations which improved upon methods then used in astronomy and geodesy it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares laplace knew how to estimate variance from residual rather than total sum of squares by laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides before astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting from reaction times the personal equation and had developed methods of reducing the errors the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong full factorial experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added an eloquent non mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in article the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance his first application of the analysis of variance was published in analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fisher book statistical methods for research workers randomization models were developed by several researchers the first was published in polish by jerzy neyman in example no fit young vs old and short haired vs long haired fair fit pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athleticvery good fit weight by breedthe analysis of variance can be used to describe otherwise complex relations among variables dog show provides an example dog show is not random sampling of the breed it is typically limited to dogs that are adult pure bred and exemplary histogram of dog weights from show might plausibly be rather complex like the yellow orange distribution shown in the illustrations suppose we wanted to predict the weight of dog based on certain set of characteristics of each dog one way to do that is to explain the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics successful grouping will split dogs such that each group has low variance of dog weights meaning the group is relatively homogeneous and the mean of each group is distinct if two groups have the same mean then it isn reasonable to conclude that the groups are in fact separate in any meaningful way in the illustrations to the right groups are identified as etc in the first illustration the dogs are divided according to the product interaction of two binary groupings young vs old and short haired vs long haired group is young short haired dogs group is young long haired dogs etc since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups shown in blue has relatively large variance and since the means are very similar across groups grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights knowing which group dog is in doesn allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in dog show thus this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution yellow orange an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful fair fit the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter as shown by the second illustration the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case and the means are more distinguishable however the significant overlap of distributions for example means that we cannot distinguish and reliably grouping dogs according to coin flip might produce distributions that look similar an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce very good fit all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models the method has some advantages over correlation not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship background and terminology anova is form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data test result calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance assuming the truth of the null hypothesis statistically significant result when probability value is less than pre specified threshold significance level justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high in the typical application of anova the null hypothesis is that all groups are random samples from the same population for example when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect perhaps none rejecting the null hypothesis is taken to mean that the differences in observed effects between treatment groups are unlikely to be due to random chance by construction hypothesis testing limits the rate of type errors false positives to significance level experimenters also wish to limit type ii errors false negatives the rate of type ii errors depends largely on sample size the rate is larger for smaller samples significance level when the standard of proof is high the chances of overlooking discovery are also high and effect size smaller effect size is more prone to type ii error the terminology of anova is largely from the statistical design of experiments the experimenter adjusts factors and measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect factors are assigned to experimental units by combination of randomization and blocking to ensure the validity of the results blinding keeps the weighing impartial responses show variability that is partially the result of the effect and is partially random error anova is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple purposes as consequence it is difficult to define concisely or precisely classical anova for balanced data does three things at once in short anova is statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data additionally as result anova has long enjoyed the status of being the most used some would say abused statistical technique in psychological research anova is probably the most useful technique in the field of statistical inference anova is difficult to teach particularly for complex experiments with split plot designs being notorious in some cases the proper application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition followed by the consultation of classic authoritative test design of experiments terms condensed from the nist engineering statistics handbook section glossary of doe terminology balanced design an experimental design where all cells treatment combinations have the same number of observations blocking schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to known change in raw materials operators machines etc become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable the reason for blocking is to isolate systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects blocking is achieved by restricting randomization design set of experimental runs which allows the fit of particular model and the estimate of effects doe design of experiments an approach to problem solving involving collection of data that will support valid defensible and supportable conclusions effect how changing the settings of factor changes the response the effect of single factor is also called main effect error unexplained variation in collection of observations doe typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error experimental unit the entity to which specific treatment combination is applied factors process inputs that an investigator manipulates to cause change in the output lack of fit error error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model including replication in doe allows separation of experimental error into its components lack of fit and random pure error model mathematical relationship which relates changes in given response to changes in one or more factors random error error that occurs due to natural variation in the process random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance random error is also called experimental error randomization schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in doe such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs replication performing the same treatment combination more than once including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error responses the output of process sometimes called dependent variable treatment treatment is specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments classes of models there are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance and these are outlined here fixed effects models the fixed effects model class of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as whole random effects models random effects model class ii is used when the treatments are not fixed this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from larger population because the levels themselves are random variables some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments multi variable generalization of simple differences differ from the fixed effects model mixed effects models mixed effects model class iii contains experimental factors of both fixed and random effects types with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types example teaching experiments could be performed by college or university department to find good introductory textbook with each text considered treatment the fixed effects model would compare list of candidate texts the random effects model would determine whether important differences exist among list of randomly selected texts the mixed effects model would compare the fixed incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive with competing definitions arguably leading toward linguistic quagmire assumptions the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches the most common of which uses linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data textbook analysis using normal distribution the analysis of variance can be presented in terms of linear model which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the responses independence of observations this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis normality the distributions of the residuals are normal equality or homogeneity of variances called the variance of data in groups should be the same the separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors are independently identically and normally distributed for fixed effects models that is that the errors are independent and randomization based analysis in randomized controlled experiment the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units following the experimental protocol this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out the objective random assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis following the ideas of peirce and ronald fisher this design based analysis was discussed and developed by francis anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state university kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david cox unit treatment additivity in its simplest form the assumption of unit treatment additivity states that the observed response from experimental unit when receiving treatment can be written as the sum of the unit response and the treatment effect that is the assumption of unit treatment additivity implies that for every treatment the th treatment has exactly the same effect on every experiment unit the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly falsified according to cox and kempthorne however many consequences of treatment unit additivity can be falsified for randomized experiment the assumption of unit treatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments therefore by contraposition necessary condition for unit treatment additivity is that the variance is constant the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design based inference that is standard in finite population survey sampling derived linear model kempthorne uses the randomization distribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce derived linear model very similar to the textbook model discussed previously the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model according to approximation theorems and simulation studies however there are differences for example the randomization based analysis results in small but strictly negative correlation between the observations in the randomization based analysis there is no assumption of normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence on the contrary the observations are dependent the randomization based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time since the randomization based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using normal linear model most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach few statisticians object to model based analysis of balanced randomized experiments statistical models for observational data however when applied to data from non randomized experiments or observational studies model based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization for observational data the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models as emphasized by ronald fisher and his followers in practice the estimates of treatment effects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent in practice statistical models and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public summary of assumptions the normal model based anova analysis assumes the independence normality and homogeneity of variances of the residuals the randomization based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the variances of the residuals as consequence of unit treatment additivity and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment both these analyses require as an assumption for the normal model analysis and as consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization based analysis however studies of processes that change variances rather than means called dispersion effects have been successfully conducted using anova there are no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality but the test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical limitations which are of continuing interest problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions the property of unit treatment additivity is not invariant under change of scale so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit treatment additivity if the response variable is expected to follow parametric family of probability distributions then the statistician may specify in the protocol for the experiment or observational study that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance also statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses which are believed to follow multiplicative model according to cauchy functional equation theorem the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition characteristics anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments those in which only the difference in outcomes is of interest the statistical significance of the experiment is determined by ratio of two variances this ratio is independent of several possible alterations to the experimental observations adding constant to all observations does not alter significance multiplying all observations by constant does not alter significance so anova statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract constant from all observations when equivalent to dropping leading digits to simplify data entry this is an example of data coding logic the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing number of means and variances dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to handbook value to determine statistical significance calculating treatment effect is then trivial the effect of any treatment is estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the observations which receive the treatment and the general mean partitioning of the sum of squares anova uses traditional standardized terminology the definitional equation of sample variance is where the divisor is called the degrees of freedom df the summation is called the sum of squares ss the result is called the mean square ms and the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean anova estimates sample variances total variance based on all the observation deviations from the grand mean an error variance based on all the observation deviations from their appropriate treatment means and treatment variance the treatment variance is based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean the result being multiplied by the number of observations in each treatment to account for the difference between the variance of observations and the variance of means the fundamental technique is partitioning of the total sum of squares ss into components related to the effects used in the model for example the model for simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels the number of degrees of freedom df can be partitioned in similar way one of these components that for error specifies chi squared distribution which describes the associated sum of squares while the same is true for treatments if there is no treatment effect see also lack of fit sum of squares the test the test is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation for example in one way or single factor anova statistical significance is tested for by comparing the test statistic where ms is mean square number of treatments and total number of cases to the distribution with degrees of freedom using the distribution is natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows scaled chi squared distribution the expected value of is where is the treatment sample size which is for no treatment effect as values of increase above the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis two apparent experimental methods of increasing are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls there are two methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test both of which produce the same result the textbook method is to compare the observed value of with the critical value of determined from tables the critical value of is function of the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the denominator and the significance level if fcritical the null hypothesis is rejected the computer method calculates the probability value of value of greater than or equal to the observed value the null hypothesis is rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance level the anova test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for fixed rate of false positive errors maximizing power for fixed significance level for example to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect the test values closely approximate the permutation test values the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses as observed by rosenbaum the anova test of the null hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect is recommended as practical test because of its robustness against many alternative distributions extended logic anova consists of separable parts partitioning sources of variance and hypothesis testing can be used individually anova is used to support other statistical tools regression is first used to fit more complex models to data then anova is used to compare models with the objective of selecting simple models that adequately describe the data such models could be fit without any reference to anova but anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients we think of the analysis of variance as way of understanding and structuring multilevel models not as an alternative to regression but as tool for summarizing complex high dimensional inferences for single factor the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely randomized experiment with single factor more complex experiments with single factor involve constraints on randomization and include completely randomized blocks and latin squares and variants graeco latin squares etc the more complex experiments share many of the complexities of multiple factors relatively complete discussion of the analysis models data summaries anova table of the completely randomized experiment is available for multiple factors anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors when the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor it is termed factorial factorial experiments are more efficient than series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases consequently factorial designs are heavily used the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has complication in way anova with factors and the anova model includes terms for the main effects and terms for interactions xy xz yz xyz all terms require hypothesis tests the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce false positive by chance fortunately experience says that high order interactions are rare the ability to detect interactions is major advantage of multiple factor anova testing one factor at time hides interactions but produces apparently inconsistent experimental results caution is advised when encountering interactions test interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if interactions are found texts vary in their recommendations regarding the continuation of the anova procedure after encountering an interaction interactions complicate the interpretation of experimental data neither the calculations of significance nor the estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding regression is often useful lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox some interactions can be removed by transformations while others cannot variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication possibly no replication with support of analytical trickery and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically or practically insignificant an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with few factors supported by many replications associated analysis some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses because experimentation is iterative the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments preparatory analysis the number of experimental units in the design of an experiment the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment experimentation is often sequential early experiments are often designed to provide mean unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error later experiments are often designed to test hypothesis that treatment effect has an important magnitude in this case the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power among other goals reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions the analysis which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards besides the power analysis there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units these include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors graphical methods based on an expected variation increase above the residuals and methods based on achieving desired confidence interval power analysis power analysis is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume certain anova design effect size in the population sample size and significance level power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true effect size several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for anova to summarize the strength of the association between predictor and the dependent variable or the overall standardized difference of the complete model standardized effect size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines however while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature non standardized measure of effect size that has immediately meaningful units may be preferable for reporting purposes model confirmation it is prudent to verify that the assumptions of anova have been met residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm and gross normality residuals should have the appearance of zero mean normal distribution noise when plotted as function of anything including time and modeled data values trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations one rule of thumb if the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results will still be approximately correct follow up tests statistically significant effect in anova is often followed up with one or more different follow up tests this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses follow up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned priori or post hoc planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data often one of the treatments is none so the treatment group can act as control dunnett test modification of the test tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same mean as the control post hoc tests such as tukey range test most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for type errors comparisons which are most commonly planned can be either simple or compound simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups compare average group means of group and with group comparisons can also look at tests of trend such as linear and quadratic relationships when the independent variable involves ordered levels following anova with pair wise multiple comparison tests has been criticized on several grounds there are many such tests in one table and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting study designs there are several types of anova many statisticians base anova on the design of the experiment especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects the protocol description of the assignment mechanism should include specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model some popular designs use the following types of anova one way anova is used to test for differences among two or more independent groups means different levels of urea application in crop or different levels of antibiotic action on several different bacterial species or different levels of effect of some medicine on groups of patients however should these groups not be independent and there is an order in the groups such as mild moderate and severe disease or in the dose of drug such as mg ml mg ml mg ml given to the same group of patients then linear trend estimation should be used typically however the one way anova is used to test for differences among at least three groups since the two group case can be covered by test when there are only two means to compare the test and the anova test are equivalent the relation between anova and is given by factorial anova is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments repeated measures anova is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment in longitudinal study multivariate analysis of variance manova is used when there is more than one response variable cautions balanced experiments those with an equal sample size for each treatment are relatively easy to interpret unbalanced experiments offer more complexity for single factor one way anova the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply consequently the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs in the general case the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data but then the sums of squares mean squares and ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation are considered the simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data more complex techniques use regression anova is in part test of statistical significance the american psychological association and many other organisations holds the view that simply reporting statistical significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred while anova is conservative in maintaining significance level against multiple comparisons in one dimension it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions common mistake is to use an anova or kruskal wallis for analysis of ordered groups in time sequence changes over months in disease severity mild moderate severe or in distance from set point km km km data in three or more ordered groups that are defined by the researcher should be analysed by linear trend estimation generalizations anova is considered to be special case of linear regression which in turn is special case of the general linear model all consider the observations to be the sum of model fit and residual error to be minimized the kruskal wallis test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests which do not rely on an assumption of normality connection to linear regression below we make clear the connection between multi way anova and linear regression linearly re order the data so that observation is associated with response and factors where denotes the different factors and is the total number of factors in one way anova and in two way anova furthermore we assume the factor has levels namely now we can one hot encode the factors into the dimensional vector the one hot encoding function is defined such that the entry of is the vector is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all thus in order to obtain fully general way interaction anova we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector and then add an intercept term let that vector be with this notation in place we now have the exact connection with linear regression we simply regress response against the vector however there is concern about identifiability in order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero from here one can use statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors example we can consider the way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has levels and the second factor has levels define if and if is the one hot encoding of the first factor and is the one hot encoding of the second factor with that where the last term is an intercept term for more concrete example suppose that then see also one way analysis of variance one way anova two way analysis of variance two way anova anova on ranks anova

chemical structure of methane the simplest alkane in organic chemistry an alkane or paraffin historical name that also has other meanings is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon in other words an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in tree structure in which all the carbon carbon bonds are single alkanes have the general chemical formula the alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane ch where sometimes called the parent molecule to arbitrarily large and complex molecules like pentacontane or ethyl methyl methylethyl octane an isomer of tetradecane international union of pure and applied chemistry defines alkanes as acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms however some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon including those that are either monocyclic the cycloalkanes or polycyclic despite their having distinct general formula cycloalkanes are in an alkane each carbon atom is sp hybridized with sigma bonds either or and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms in bond the longest series of linked carbon atoms in molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone the number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane one group of the higher alkanes are waxes solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure satp for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about with their repeated ch units the alkanes constitute homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of the total mass of each such methylene bridge unit which comprises single carbon atom of mass and two hydrogen atoms of mass each methane is produced by methanogenic bacteria and some long chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi nevertheless most alkanes do not have much biological activity they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active reactive functional groups of biological molecules the alkanes have two main commercial sources petroleum crude oil and natural gas an alkyl group is an alkane based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding they are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group although alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group structure and classification saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons having only single covalent bonds between their carbons they can be linear general formula wherein the carbon atoms are joined in snake like structure branched general formula wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions cyclic general formula wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form loop according to the definition by iupac the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic polycyclic and branching structures the general formula is where is the number of independent loops alkanes are the acyclic loopless ones corresponding to isomerism butane and isobutane are the two isomers cyclobutane and are the two alkane isomers bicyclobutane bicyclo butane is the only alkane and has no alkane isomer tetrahedrane below is the only alkane and so has no alkane isomer tetrahedrane alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various ways forming structural isomers the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in single chain with no branches this isomer is sometimes called the isomer for normal although it is not necessarily the most common however the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for example for acyclic alkanes methane only ethane only propane only isomers butane and isobutane isomers pentane isopentane and neopentane isomers hexane methylpentane methylpentane dimethylbutane and dimethylbutane isomers heptane methylhexane isomers dimethylpentane isomers ethylpentane trimethylbutane isomers isomers isomers many of which are not stable branched alkanes can be chiral for example methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number the above list only includes differences of connectivity not stereochemistry in addition to the alkane isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings such compounds are called cycloalkanes and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the molecular formula cyclobutane and are isomers of each other but are not isomers of butane nomenclature the iupac nomenclature systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane in august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels and to create suffixes ane ene ine or yne one une for the hydrocarbons now the first three name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds one represents ketone ol represents an alcohol or oh group oxy means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons so that methoxymethane is the iupac name for dimethyl ether it is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one iupac name this is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets numbers in the name referring to which carbon group is attached to should be as low as possible so that is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side group symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name linear alkanes straight chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix or for normal where non linear isomer exists although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight chain and branched chain isomers hexane or or methylpentane alternative names for this group are linear paraffins or paraffins the members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows methane ch one carbon and hydrogen ethane two carbon and hydrogen propane three carbon and hydrogen butane four carbon and hydrogen pentane five carbon and hydrogen hexane six carbon and hydrogen the first four names were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid respectively hexadecane is also sometimes referred to as cetane alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel or from the basic numerical term hence pentane hexane heptane octane etc the prefix is generally greek however alkanes with carbon atom count ending in nine for example nonane use the latin prefix non for more complete list see list of alkanes branched alkanes ball and stick model of isopentane common name or methylbutane iupac systematic name simple branched alkanes often have common name using prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example pentane isopentane and neopentane iupac naming conventions can be used to produce systematic name the key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms name this longest root chain using standard naming rules name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from ane to yl number the longest continuous chain in order to give the lowest possible numbers for the side chains number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain if there are multiple side chains of the same type use prefixes such as di and tri to indicate it as such and number each one add side chain names in alphabetical disregarding di etc prefixes order in front of the name of the root chain comparison of nomenclatures for three isomers of common name pentane isopentane neopentane iupac name pentane methylbutane dimethylpropane structure px px px saturated cyclic hydrocarbons though technically distinct from the alkanes this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the cyclic alkanes as their description implies they contain one or more rings simple cycloalkanes have prefix cyclo to distinguish them from alkanes cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones cyclopentane is cycloalkane with carbon atoms just like pentane but they are joined up in five membered ring in similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane etc substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by the cahn ingold prelog priority rules trivial common names the trivial non systematic name for alkanes is paraffins together alkanes are known as the paraffin series trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts they were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes it is almost certain that the term paraffin stems from the petrochemical industry branched chain alkanes are called isoparaffins the use of the term paraffin is general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers compounds of the same chemical formula pentane and isopentane in iupac the following trivial names are retained in the iupac system isobutane for methylpropane isopentane for methylbutane neopentane for dimethylpropane non iupac some non iupac trivial names are occasionally used cetane for hexadecane cerane for hexacosane physical properties all alkanes are colorless alkanes with the lowest molecular weights are gasses those of intermediate molecular weight are liquids and the heaviest are waxy solids table of alkanes alkane formula boiling point melting point density kg at isomers methane ch gas ethane gas propane gas butane gas pentane liquid hexane liquid heptane liquid octane

solid triacontane solid tetracontane solid pentacontane solid hexacontane solid heptacontane solid boiling point melting blue and boiling orange points of the first alkanes in alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces stronger intermolecular van der waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes there are two determinants for the strength of the van der waals forces the number of electrons surrounding the molecule which increases with the alkane molecular weight the surface area of the molecule under standard conditions from ch to alkanes are gaseous from to they are liquids and after they are solids as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be surprise that the boiling point has almost linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecule as rule of thumb the boiling point rises for each carbon added to the chain this rule applies to other homologous series straight chain alkane will have boiling point higher than branched chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact thus the greater van der waals forces between adjacent molecules for example compare isobutane methylpropane and butane butane which boil at and and dimethylbutane and dimethylbutane which boil at and respectively for the latter case two molecules dimethylbutane can lock into each other better than the cross shaped dimethylbutane hence the greater van der waals forces on the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give plane of intermolecular contact melting points the melting points of the alkanes follow similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above that is all other things being equal the larger the molecule the higher the melting point there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids this rigid structure requires energy to break down thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart for alkanes this can be seen from the graph above the blue line the odd numbered alkanes have lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes this is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming well organized structure which requires more energy to break apart the odd numbered alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart for visualization of the crystal structures see the melting points of branched chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight chain alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase this is particularly true for isoalkanes methyl isomers which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues conductivity and solubility alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field for this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order reduction in entropy as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic as they repel water their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high property that is called lipophilicity alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves the density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane water mixture molecular geometry sp hybridization in methane the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons the carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp hybridized that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the orbital and the three orbitals these orbitals which have identical energies are arranged spatially in the form of tetrahedron the angle of cos between them bond lengths and bond angles an alkane has only and single bonds the former result from the overlap of an sp orbital of carbon with the orbital of hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sp orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to for bond and for bond the tetrahedral structure of methane the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals they are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of between them structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with the reality conformation the structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of molecule there is further degree of freedom for each carbon carbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond the spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation newman projections of the two conformations of ethane eclipsed on the left staggered on the right ball and stick models of the two rotamers of ethane ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there is only one bond if one looks down the axis of the bond one will see the so called newman projection the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto flat plane however the torsion angle between given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between and this is consequence of the free rotation about carbon carbon single bond despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation the two conformations differ in energy the staggered conformation is kj mol lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the least stable this difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature there is constant rotation about the bond the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent to the rotation of one ch group by relative to the other is of the order of seconds the case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon carbon bond for this reason alkanes are usually shown in zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggest spectroscopic properties virtually all organic compounds contain carbon carbon and carbon hydrogen bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features of functional group like oh cho cooh etc infrared spectroscopy the carbon hydrogen stretching mode gives strong absorption between and cm while the carbon carbon stretching mode absorbs between and cm the carbon hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at cm and cm while methylene groups show bands at cm and cm carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show weak absorption at around cm nmr spectroscopy the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at the carbon resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon primary methyl ch secondary methylene ch tertiary methyne and quaternary the carbon resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is weak due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for sufficiently long time mass spectrometry alkanes have high ionization energy and the molecular ion is usually weak the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals the fragment resulting from the loss of single methyl group is often absent and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of ch groups chemical properties alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds the acid dissociation constant values of all alkanes are estimated to range from to depending on the extrapolation method hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases see carbon acids they are also extremely weak bases undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid although superacids that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions see methanium ion similarly they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents dioxiranes and salts containing the nf cation by virtue of their strongly bonds kcal mol and bonds kcal mol but usually less sterically accessible they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals although many electron deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other electron rich bonds see below this inertness is the source of the term paraffins with the meaning here of lacking affinity in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where long chain alkanes are converted into shorter chain alkanes and straight chain alkanes into branched chain isomers moreover redox reactions of alkanes involving free radical intermediates in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in strongly reduced state in the case of methane carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state reaction with oxygen if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry leads to combustion without any smoke producing carbon dioxide and water free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes in addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes in bond activation reactions in highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value to accommodate bulky groups such distortions introduce tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance or strain strain substantially increases reactivity however in general and perhaps surprisingly when branching is not extensive enough to make highly disfavorable and alkyl alkyl steric interactions worth kcal mol and kcal mol in the case of the eclipsing conformations of butane and pentane respectively unavoidable the branched alkanes are actually more stable than their linear or less branched isomers for example the highly branched is about kcal mol more stable than its linear isomer octane due to the subtlety of this effect the exact reasons for this rule have been vigorously debated in the chemical literature and is yet unsettled several explanations including stabilization of branched alkanes by electron correlation destabilization of linear alkanes by steric repulsion stabilization by neutral and or electrostatic effects have been advanced as possibilities the controversy is related to the question of whether the traditional explanation of is the primary factor governing the stability of alkyl radicals reactions with oxygen combustion reaction all alkanes react with oxygen in combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases the general equation for complete combustion is co or co in the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below co for example methane ch co ch co see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data the standard enthalpy change of combustion δc for alkanes increases by about kj mol per ch group branched chain alkanes have lower values of δc than straight chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable reactions with halogens alkanes react with halogens in so called free radical halogenation reaction the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms free radicals are the reactive species that participate in the reaction which usually leads to mixture of products the reaction is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons there are three steps initiation the halogen radicals form by homolysis usually energy in the form of heat or light is required chain reaction or propagation then takes place the halogen radical abstracts hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical this reacts further chain termination where the radicals recombine experiments have shown that all halogenation produces mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction the mixture produced however is not statistical mixture secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free radicals an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane monobromination of propane cracking cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones this can be done with thermal or catalytic method the thermal cracking process follows homolytic mechanism with formation of free radicals the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as silica alumina and zeolites which promote heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion carbon localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement scission in position beta cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by self propagating chain mechanism the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination isomerization and reformation dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight chain alkanes are heated in the presence of platinum catalyst in isomerization the alkanes become branched chain isomers in other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight in reformation the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons giving off hydrogen as by product both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers other reactions alkanes will react with steam in the presence of nickel catalyst to give hydrogen alkanes can be and nitrated although both reactions require special conditions the fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides nucleophilic abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from metal alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions mixture of antimony pentafluoride sbf and fluorosulfonic acid hso called magic acid can protonate alkanes occurrence occurrence of alkanes in the universe methane and ethane make up tiny

also been detected in the tail of the comet hyakutake chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites occurrence of alkanes on earth traces of methane gas about or ppb occur in the earth atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms such as archaea in the gut of ruminants the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons these hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction ch co these hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis methane is also present in what is called biogas produced by animals and decaying matter which is possible renewable energy source alkanes have low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is negligible however at high pressures and low temperatures such as at the bottom of the oceans methane can co crystallize with water to form solid methane clathrate methane hydrate although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore candidate for future fuels biological occurrence acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways bacteria and archaea methanogenic archaea in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the methane in earth atmosphere certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes they prefer even numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd numbered chains on the other hand certain archaea the methanogens produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen co ch methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands the methane output of cattle and other herbivores which can release to gallons per day and of termites is also due to methanogens they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in similar way fungi and plants alkanes also play role if minor role in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms fungi plants and animals some specialized yeasts candida tropicale pichia sp rhodotorula sp can use alkanes as source of carbon or energy the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer chain alkanes in aviation fuel and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions in plants the solid long chain alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species but are only rarely major constituents they protect the plant against water loss prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain and protect against bacteria fungi and harmful insects the carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd numbered between and carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of even numbered fatty acids the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions temperature or humidity more volatile short chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues the jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of heptane in its resin for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components and nonane is significant component in the scent of some roses emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane pentane and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels though they are not generally considered to be major component of biogenic air pollution edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with wide spectrum of carbon numbers mainly to usually peaking in the low to upper with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram parts per million by weight and sometimes over hundred for the total alkane fraction animals alkanes are found in animal products although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons one example is the shark liver oil which is approximately pristane they are important as pheromones chemical messenger materials on which insects depend for communication in some species the support beetle xylotrechus colonus pentacosane and are transferred by body contact with others like the tsetse fly glossina morsitans morsitans the pheromone contains the four alkanes and and acts by smell over longer distances waggle dancing honey bees produce and release two alkanes tricosane and pentacosane ecological relations early spider orchid ophrys sphegodes one example in which both plant and animal alkanes play role is the ecological relationship between the sand bee andrena nigroaenea and the early spider orchid ophrys sphegodes the latter is dependent for pollination on the former sand bees use pheromones in order to identify mate in the case of nigroaenea the females emit mixture of tricosane pentacosane and heptacosane in the ratio and males are attracted by specifically this odor the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees as result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to other blooms production petroleum refining an oil refinery at martinez california as stated earlier the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many products fischer tropsch the fischer tropsch process is method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons including alkanes from carbon monoxide and hydrogen this method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates laboratory preparation there is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory since they are usually commercially available also alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically and do not undergo functional group cleanly when alkanes are produced in the laboratory it is often side product of reaction for example the use of butyllithium as strong base gives the conjugate acid butane as side product li lioh however at times it may be desirable to make section of molecule into an alkane like functionality alkyl group using the above or similar methods for example an ethyl group is an alkyl group when this is attached to hydroxy group it gives ethanol which is not an alkane to do so the best known methods are hydrogenation of alkenes rch ch rch ch alkyl alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the corey house posner whitesides reaction the barton mccombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols barton mccombie deoxygenation scheme and the clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl substituted compounds clemmensen reduction preparation of alkanes from other organic compounds alkanes can be prepared from variety of organic compounds these include alkenes alkynes haloalkanes alcohols aldehydes and ketones and carboxylic acids from alkenes and alkynes when alkenes and alkynes are subjected to hydrogenation reaction by treating them with hydrogen in the presence of palladium or platinum or nickel catalyst they produce alkanes in this reaction powdered catalyst is preferred to increase the surface area so that adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst increases in this reaction the hydrogen gets attached on the catalyst to form hydrogen catalyst bond which leads to weakening of bond thereby leading to the addition of hydrogen on alkenes and alkynes the reaction is exothermic because the product alkane is stable as it has more sigma bonds than the reactant alkenes and alkynes due to conversion of pi bond to sigma bonds sabatier saddaren reduction of alkane may also be considered as in this category from haloalkanes alkanes can be produced from haloalkanes using different methods wurtz reaction when haloalkane is treated with sodium in dry ether alkane with double the number of carbon atoms is obtained this reaction proceeds through free radical intermediate and has possibility of alkene formation in case of tertiary haloalkanes and vicinal dihalides corey house synthesis when haloalkane is treated with dialkyl lithium cuprite which is otherwise known as gilman reagent any higher alkane is obtained reaction with metal hydride when haloalkanes are treated with metal hydride eg sodium hydride and lithium aluminium hydride frankland reaction when haloalkane is treated with zinc in ester alkane is obtained fittig reaction when aryl halide is treated with sodium in dry ether it forms biphenyl ullmann biaryl synthesis when aryl halide is treated with copper it forms biphenyl wurtz fittig reaction when aryl halide is treated with haloalkane we get alkyl benzene applications the applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes and in some countries for electricity generation methane and ethane are the main components of natural gas they are normally stored as gases under pressure it is however easier to transport them as liquids this requires both compression and cooling of the gas propane and butane are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as liquified petroleum gas lpg propane is used in propane gas burners and as fuel for road vehicles butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the uniformity of the combustion branched chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their straight chain homologues this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel where isooctane has an arbitrary value of and heptane has value of zero apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable for use in gasoline they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane however the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil in the latter function they work at the same time as anti corrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candles this should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of esters alkanes with chain length of approximately or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing however the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds or thousands of carbon atoms these materials are used in innumerable applications and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year environmental transformations alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds this inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms there are however some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize alkanes as both carbon and energy sources some bacterial species are highly specialised in degrading alkanes these are referred to as bacteria hazards methane is flammable explosive and dangerous to inhale because it is colorless odorless gas special caution must be taken around methane ethane is also extremely flammable explosive and dangerous to inhale both of them may cause suffocation propane too is flammable and explosive and may cause drowsiness or unconsciousness if inhaled butane presents the same hazards as propane alkanes also pose threat to the environment branched alkanes have lower than unbranched alkanes methane is considered to be the greenhouse gas that is most dangerous to the environment although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is relatively low see also alkene alkyne cycloalkane higher alkanes references further reading

court of appeals in washington united states appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing appeals in state courts and federal courts the nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted there are many types of standard of review for appeals such as de novo and abuse of discretion however most appeals begin when party files petition for review to higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court decision an appellate court is court that hears cases on appeal from another court depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance party to court case who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds these grounds typically could include errors of law fact procedure or due process in different jurisdictions appellate courts are also called appeals courts courts of appeals superior courts or supreme courts the specific procedures for appealing including even whether there is right of appeal from particular type of decision can vary greatly from state to state the right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state for example the new jersey constitution vests judicial power in supreme court superior court and other courts of limited jurisdiction with an appellate court being part of the superior court access to appellant status party who files an appeal is called an appellant plaintiff in error petitioner or pursuer and party on the other side is called an appellee cross appeal is an appeal brought by the respondent for example suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay if the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money then the plaintiff might file cross appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay instead of the appellant is the party who having lost part or all their claim in lower court decision is appealing to higher court to have their case reconsidered this is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct or that finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence the appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff or claimant defendant third party intervenor or respondent appellee from the lower case depending on who was the losing party the winning party from the lower court however is now the respondent in unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below but still appeal an appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment was in its favor the appellee is required to respond to the petition oral arguments and legal briefs of the appellant in general the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court decision should be affirmed ability to appeal an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal in such situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant demand to appeal the lower court decision in the supreme court review in most cases is available only if the court exercises its discretion and grants writ of certiorari in tort equity or other civil matters either party to previous case may file an appeal in criminal matters however the state or prosecution generally has no appeal as of right and due to the double jeopardy principle the state or prosecution may never appeal jury or bench verdict of acquittal but in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from trial court dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from trial court granting of defendant suppression motion likewise in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court or the appellate court the ability of the prosecution to appeal decision in favor of defendant varies significantly internationally all parties must present grounds to appeal or it will not be heard by convention in some law reports the appellant is named first this can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals the name of the case in the law reports reverses in some cases twice as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy this is not always true however in the federal courts the parties names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the circuit courts of appeals and are re ordered only if the appeal reaches the supreme court direct or collateral appealing criminal convictions many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals particularly in the criminal context the first is the traditional direct appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review the second is the collateral appeal or post conviction petition in which the petitioner appellant files the appeal in court of first instance usually the court that tried the case the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts and the latter in federal courts relief in post conviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendant actual innocence appellate review appellate review is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts it is distinguished from judicial review which refers to the court overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons which may vary by jurisdiction in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment generally an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case this is because such orders cannot be appealed as of right however certain critical interlocutory court orders such as the denial of request for an interim injunction or an order holding person in contempt of court can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of there are two distinct forms of appellate review direct and collateral for example criminal defendant may be convicted in state court and lose on direct appeal to higher state appellate courts and if unsuccessful mount collateral action such as filing for writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts generally speaking direct appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of judgment and allege errors of law or fact collateral review on the other hand provides an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of conviction and sentence and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional jurisdictional or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial graham borgen th cir no slip op at citation omitted in anglo american common law courts appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases there is no corresponding right to writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems though some mixed systems such as quebec recognize these prerogative writs direct appeal after exhausting the first appeal as of right defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision this appeal is known as direct appeal the highest state court generally known as the supreme court exercises discretion over whether it will review the case on direct appeal prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process preservation issues an appellant claim must usually be preserved at trial this means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial because constitutional claims are of great magnitude appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved for example connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of fundamental right the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of fair trial if subject to harmless error analysis the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond reasonable doubt state post conviction relief collateral appeal all states have post conviction relief process similar to federal post conviction relief an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on new evidence these proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal after direct appeal the conviction is considered final an appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as direct appeal that is it goes to the intermediate appellate court followed by the highest court if the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration the sentence could be modified or new trial could be ordered habeas corpus notice of appeal notice of appeal is form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal the form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant legal representative the nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within country the specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun for example the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court or with the court from which the appeal is taken or both some courts have samples of notice of appeal on the court own web site in new jersey for example the administrative office of the court has promulgated form of notice of appeal for use by appellants though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used the deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short traditionally it is measured in days not months this can vary from country to country as well as within country depending on the specific rules in force in the federal court system criminal defendants must file notice of appeal within days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed or the right to appeal is forfeited appellate procedure generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court findings of fact such as whether defendant committed particular act unless clearly erroneous and so will focus on the court application of the law to those facts such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits legal definition at issue if the appellate court finds no defect it affirms the judgment if the appellate court does find legal defect in the decision below in the lower court it may modify the ruling to correct the defect or it may nullify reverse or vacate the whole decision or any part of it it may in addition send the case back remand or remit to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect in some cases an appellate court may review lower court decision de novo or completely challenging even the lower court findings of fact this might be the proper standard of review for example if the lower court resolved the case by granting pre trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony another situation is where appeal is by way of re hearing certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court sometimes the appellate court finds defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below this would happen for example if the appellant waited too long under the appellate court rules to file the appeal generally there is no trial in an appellate court only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed unless the appeal is by way of re hearing new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances for example if that material evidence was unavailable to party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct in some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal in other systems the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee or respondent can present arguments against it arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers if represented or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at hearing at such hearings each party is allowed brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless party appeals it therefore if lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against legal precedent that judgment will stand if not appealed even if it might have been overturned on appeal the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals trial de novo or an appeal on the record trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of formal judicial trial if unchallenged these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all if party is dissatisfied with the finding of such tribunal one generally has the power to request trial de novo by court of record in such proceeding all issues and evidence may be developed newly as though never heard before and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding sometimes however the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence thus helping to curb frivolous appeals in some cases an application for trial de novo effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place the supreme court of virginia has stated that this court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial the only exception to this is that if defendant appeals conviction for crime having multiple levels of offenses where they are convicted on lesser offense the appeal is of the lesser offense the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles subject only to the limitation that conviction in the district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser included offense in an appeal on the record from decision in judicial proceeding both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments in order for the appeal to succeed the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error that is an impermissible action by the court acted to cause result that was unjust and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney admitting or excluding evidence improperly acting outside the court jurisdiction injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so juror misconduct etc the failure to formally object at the time to what one views as improper action in the lower court may result in the affirmance of the lower court judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting in cases where judge rather than jury decided issues of fact an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review under this standard the appellate court gives deference to the lower court view of the evidence and reverses its decision only if it were clear abuse of discretion this is usually defined as decision outside the bounds of reasonableness on the other hand the appellate court normally gives less deference to lower court decision on issues of law and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard in some cases an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was or otherwise invalid or may convince the higher court to order new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered in the case of new evidence there must be high probability that its presence or absence would have made material difference in the trial another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel if defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation he is entitled to new trial lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court after an appeal is heard the mandate is formal notice of decision by court of appeal this notice is transmitted to the trial court and when filed by the clerk of the trial court constitutes the final judgment on the case unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court the mandate is distinguished from the appeal court opinion which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision in some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the remittitur results the result of an appeal can be affirmed where the reviewing court basically agrees with the result of the lower courts ruling reversed where the reviewing court basically disagrees with the result of the lower courts ruling and overturns their decision vacated where the reviewing court overturns the lower courts ruling as invalid without necessarily disagreeing with it them because the case was decided on the basis of legal principle that no longer applies remanded where the reviewing court sends the case back to the lower court there can be multiple outcomes so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings reverse others and remand the case all at the same time remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case generally speaking an appellate court judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the court determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modified some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send case back without comment other than review improvidently granted in other words after looking at the case they chose not to say anything the result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed but without that extra higher court stamp of

in law an answer was originally solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something and thus generally any counter statement or defense reply to question or response or objection or correct solution of problem in the common law an answer is the first pleading by defendant usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within certain strict time limit after civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant it may have been preceded by an optional pre answer motion to dismiss or demurrer if such motion is unsuccessful the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment in criminal case there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court the pleading in the criminal case which is entered on the record in open court is usually either guilty or not guilty generally speaking in private civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence there is only judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or permanent injunction criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment such as imprisonment the famous latin responsa prudentium answers of the learned ones were the accumulated views of many successive generations of roman lawyers body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative during debates of contentious nature deflection colloquially known as changing the topic has been widely observed and is often seen as failure to answer question notes
the high court of australia the highest appellate court in australia an appellate court commonly called an appeals court court of appeals american english appeal court british english court of second instance or second instance court is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of trial court or other lower tribunal in most jurisdictions the court system is divided into at least three levels the trial court which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case at least one intermediate appellate court and supreme court or court of last resort which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts jurisdiction supreme court is that jurisdiction highest appellate court appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules the authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another in some areas the appellate court has limited powers of review generally an appellate court judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the court determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modified bifurcation of civil and criminal appeals while in many appellate courts have jurisdiction over all cases decided by lower courts some systems have appellate courts divided by the type of jurisdiction they exercise some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts such as the texas court of criminal appeals which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases and the court of appeals for the federal circuit which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases on one hand and appeals from the court of federal claims on the other in the united states alabama tennessee and oklahoma also have separate courts of criminal appeals texas and oklahoma have the final determination of criminal cases vested in their respective courts of criminal appeals while alabama and tennessee allow decisions of its court of criminal appeals to be finally appealed to the state supreme court courts of criminal appeals court of criminal

zealand the court of appeal of new zealand located in wellington is new zealand principal intermediate appellate court in practice most appeals are resolved at this intermediate appellate level rather than in the supreme court sri lanka the court of appeal of sri lanka located in colombo is the second senior court in the sri lankan legal system united kingdom united states in the united states both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were furthermore appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court hence such an appellate court will not consider an appellant argument if it is based on theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal in most states and in federal courts parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right this means that party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome however appeals may be costly and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict therefore only small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals some appellate courts particularly supreme courts have the power of discretionary review meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in particular case institutional titles many jurisdictions title their appellate court court of appeal or court of appeals historically others have titled their appellate court court of errors or court of errors and appeals on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts examples of such courts include the new jersey court of errors and appeals which existed from to the connecticut supreme court of errors which has been renamed the connecticut supreme court the kentucky court of errors renamed the kentucky supreme court and the mississippi high court of errors and appeals since renamed the supreme court of mississippi in some jurisdictions court able to hear appeals is known as an appellate division the phrase court of appeals most often refers to intermediate appellate courts however the maryland and new york systems are different the maryland court of

arraignment at the ministries trial december arraignment is formal reading of criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant to inform him of the charges against the defendant in response to arraignment the accused is expected to enter plea acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions but they generally include guilty not guilty and the peremptory pleas or pleas in bar setting out reasons why trial cannot proceed pleas of nolo contendere no contest and the alford plea are allowed in some circumstances australia in australia arraignment is the first of eleven stages in criminal trial and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment the judge will testify during the indictment process canada in every province in canada except british columbia defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial in british columbia arraignment takes place in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer the defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge france in france the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than hours from the time of the arrest however police custody can last another hours in specific circumstances especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year imprisonment or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time and can last up to hours in certain cases involving terrorism drug trafficking or organised crime the police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor in the vast majority of cases the prosecutor will consent germany in germany if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest new zealand at the first appearance the accused is read the charges and asked for plea the available pleas are guilty not guilty and no plea no plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea which must be made on the second appearance south africa in south africa arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear the informing of the accused of the crime charged against him the demanding of the accused whether he be guilty or not guilty and the entering of his plea his plea having been entered he is said to stand arraigned united kingdom in england wales and northern ireland arraignment is the first of eleven stages in criminal trial and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment in england and wales the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent or above authorises detention for further hours hours total or judge who will be magistrate authorises detention by the police before charge for up to maximum of hours but for terrorism related offences people can be held by the police for up to days before charge if they are not released after being charged they should be brought before court as soon as practicable united states under the united states federal rules of criminal procedure arraignment shall consist of an open reading of the indictment to the defendant and call on him to plead thereto he she shall be given copy of the indictment before he she is called upon to plead in federal courts arraignment takes place in two stages the first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within hours of an individual arrest hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before judge until monday during this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel the presiding judge also decides at what amount if any to set bail during the second arraignment post indictment arraignment pia the defendant is allowed to enter plea in new york most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within hours in california arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and in any event within hours of arrest excluding weekends and holidays form of the arraignment the wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction however it generally conforms with the following principles the accused person defendant is addressed by name the charge against the accused person is read including the alleged date time and place of offense and sometimes the names of the state witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge and the accused person is asked formally how he or she pleads video arraignment video arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of technology use of video arraignment system allows the courts to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an audio visual link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants the transportation of defendants requires time puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention it also addresses the rising costs of transportation guilty and not guilty pleas if the defendant pleads guilty an evidentiary hearing usually follows the court is not required to accept guilty plea during the hearing the judge assesses the offense the mitigating factors and the defendant character and passes sentence if the defendant pleads not guilty date is set for preliminary hearing or trial in the past defendant who refused to plead or stood mute was subject to peine forte et dure law french for strong and hard punishment today in common law jurisdictions the court enters plea of not guilty for defendant who refuses to enter plea the rationale for this is the defendant right to silence pre trial release this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre trial release and bail may be made depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction see also desk appearance ticket references
america the beautiful is an american patriotic song the lyrics were written by katharine lee bates and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster samuel ward at grace episcopal church in newark new jersey the two never met bates originally wrote the words as poem pikes peak first published in the fourth of july edition of the church periodical the in at that time the poem was titled america for publication ward had originally written the music materna for the hymn mother dear jerusalem in though it was not first published until ward music combined with the bates poem was first published in and titled america the beautiful the song is one of the most popular of the many patriotic songs history commemoration plaque atop pikes peak in july in at the age of bates an english professor at wellesley college had taken train trip to colorado springs colorado to teach short summer school session at colorado college several of the sights on her trip inspired her and they found their way into her poem including the world columbian exposition in chicago the white city with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white buildings the wheat fields of america heartland kansas through which her train was riding on july and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop pikes peak on the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hotel the poem was initially published two years later in the to commemorate the fourth of july it quickly caught the public fancy an amended version was published in grace church in newark where samuel ward worked as organist and wrote and perfected the tune materna that is used for america the beautiful the first known melody written for the song was sent in by silas pratt when the poem was published in the by at least different melodies had been written hymn tune composed in by samuel ward the organist and choir director at grace church newark was generally considered the best music as early as and is still the popular tune today just as bates had been inspired to write her poem ward too was inspired the tune came to him while he was on ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down he composed the tune for the old hymn mother dear jerusalem retitling the work materna ward music combined with bates poem were first published together in and titled america the beautiful ward died in not knowing the national stature his music would attain bates was more fortunate since the song popularity was well established by the time of her death in it is included in songbooks in many religious congregations in the united states at various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the john kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as national hymn or as national anthem equal to or in place of the star spangled banner but so far this has not succeeded proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the star spangled banner some prefer america the beautiful over the star spangled banner due to the latter war oriented imagery others prefer the star spangled banner for the same reason while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by large number of americans and was even being considered before as candidate to become the national anthem of the united states lyrics america poem for july original poem great for halcyon skies for amber waves of grain for purple mountain majesties above the

performing activities of daily living adls independently or even with assistance adls are self care activities that include toileting mobility ambulation eating bathing dressing grooming and personal device care assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform adls assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they were formerly unable to accomplish or had great difficulty accomplishing by providing enhancements to or changing methods of interacting with the technology needed to accomplish such tasks for example wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk while assistive eating devices can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so due to assistive technology people with disabilities have an opportunity of more positive and easygoing lifestyle with an increase in social participation security and control and greater chance to reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses adaptive technology adaptive technology and assistive technology are different assistive technology is something that is used to help individuals with disabilities while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for people with disabilities and would seldom be used by non disabled person in other words assistive technology is any object or system that helps people with disabilities while adaptive technology is specifically designed for people with disabilities consequently adaptive technology is subset of assistive technology adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access occupational therapy occupational therapy ot is healthcare profession that specializes in maintaining or improving the quality of life for individuals that experience challenges when independently performing life occupations according to the occupational therapy practice framework domain and process rd ed aota occupations include areas related to all basic and instrumental activities of daily living adls rest and sleep education work play leisure and social participation occupational therapists have the specialized skill of employing assistive technology at in the improvement and maintenance of optimal functional participation in occupations the application of at enables an individual to adapt aspects of the environment that may otherwise be challenging to the user in order to optimize functional participation in those occupations as result occupational therapists may educate recommend and promote the use of at to improve the quality of life for their clients mobility impairments wheelchair propelled by attached handcycle wheelchairs wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include seating system and are designed to be substitute for the normal mobility that most people have wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related activities of daily living which include feeding toileting dressing grooming and bathing the devices come in number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through joystick sip and puff control head switches or other input devices often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness injury or disability people with both sitting and walking disability often need to use wheelchair or walker newer advancements in wheelchair design enable wheelchairs to climb stairs go off road or propel using segway technology or additional add ons like handbikes or power assists power add on transfer devices patient transfer devices generally allow patients with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds wheelchairs commodes toilets chairs stretchers shower benches automobiles swimming pools and other patient support systems radiology surgical or examining tables the most common devices are patient lifts for vertical transfer transfer benches stretcher or convertible chairs for lateral supine transfer sit to stand lifts for moving patients from one seated position to another from wheelchairs to commodes air bearing inflatable mattresses for supine transfer transfer from gurney to an operating room table and sliding boards usually used for transfer from bed to wheelchair highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require patient lift floor or ceiling suspended sling lift which though invented in and in common use since the early is still considered the state of the art transfer device by osha and the american nursing association walkers walker or walking frame or rollator is tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking it consists of frame that is about waist high approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user walkers are also available in other sizes such as for children or for heavy people modern walkers are height adjustable the front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it it is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of walker with wheels on the front prosthesis prosthesis prosthetic or prosthetic limb is device that replaces missing body part it is part of the field of biomechatronics the science of using mechanical devices with human muscle skeleton and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma disease or defect prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury traumatic or missing from birth congenital or to supplement defective body parts inside the body artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids artificial eyes palatal obturator gastric bands and dentures prostheses are specifically not orthoses although given certain circumstances prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis prostheses are technically the complete finished item for instance leg knee alone is not prosthesis but only prosthetic component the complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system to the residual limb usually socket and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged the terms prosthetic and orthotic are adjectives used to describe devices such as prosthetic knee the terms prosthetics and orthotics are used to describe the respective allied health fields exoskeletons powered exoskeleton is wearable mobile machine that is powered by system of electric motors pneumatics levers hydraulics or combination of technologies that allow for limb movement with increased strength and endurance its design aims to provide back support sense the user motion and send signal to motors which manage the gears the exoskeleton supports the shoulder waist and thigh and assists movement for lifting and holding heavy items while lowering back stress adaptive seating and positioning people with balance and motor function challenges often need specialized equipment to sit or stand safely and securely this equipment is frequently specialized for specific settings such as in classroom or nursing home positioning is often important in seating arrangements to ensure that user body pressure is distributed equally without inhibiting movement in desired way positioning devices have been developed to aid in allowing people to stand and bear weight on their legs without risk of fall these standers are generally grouped into two categories based on the position of the occupant prone standers distribute the body weight to the front of the individual and usually have tray in front of them this makes them good for users who are actively trying to carry out some task supine standers distribute the body weight to the back and are good for cases where the user has more limited mobility or is recovering from injury visual impairments many people with serious visual impairments live independently using wide range of tools and techniques examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers screen magnifiers braille embossers desktop video magnifiers and voice recorders screen readers screen readers are used to help the visually impaired to easily access electronic information these software programs run on computer in order to convey the displayed information through voice text to speech or braille refreshable braille displays in combination with magnification for low vision users in some cases there are variety of platforms and applications available for variety of costs with differing feature sets some example of screen readers are apple voiceover google talkback and microsoft narrator this software is provided free of charge on all apple devices apple voiceover includes the option to magnify the screen control the keyboard and provide verbal descriptions to describe what is happening on the screen there are thirty languages to select from it also has the capacity to read aloud file content as well as web pages mail messages and word processing files braille is system of raised dots representing letters numbers punctuation and words as mentioned above screen readers may rely on the assistance of text to speech tools to use the text to speech tools the documents must in an electronic form that is uploaded as the digital format however people usually will use the hard copy documents scanned into the computer which is cannot be recognized by the text to speech software to solve this issue people always use optical character recognition technology accompanied with text to speech software braille and braille embossers braille is system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells full braille cell is made up of six dots with two parallel rows of three dots but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters numbers punctuation marks or words people can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots braille embosser is simply put printer for braille instead of standard printer adding ink onto page the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto page some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch refreshable braille display refreshable braille display or braille terminal is an electro mechanical device for displaying braille characters usually by means of round tipped pins raised through holes in flat surface computer users who cannot use computer monitor use it to read braille output version of the displayed text desktop video magnifier desktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use camera and display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials they enlarge printed pages for those with low vision camera connects to monitor that displays real time images and the user can control settings such as magnification focus contrast underlining highlighting and other screen preferences they come in variety of sizes and styles some are small and portable with handheld cameras while others are much larger and mounted on fixed stand screen magnification software screen magnifier is software that interfaces with computer graphical output to present enlarged screen content it allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing similar to desktop video magnifiers this technology assists people with low vision after the user loads the software into their computer memory it serves as kind of computer magnifying glass wherever the computer cursor moves it enlarges the area around it this allows greater computer accessibility for wide range of visual abilities alt magic large print this magic large print keyboard has tactile elements and special keys for the visually impaired large print and tactile keyboards large print keyboard has large letters printed on the keys on the keyboard shown the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen zoom in change the background color of the screen or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger the bump dots on the keys installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards help the user find the right keys in tactile way navigation assistance assistive technology for navigation has exploded on the ieee xplore database since with over engineering articles written on assistive technologies and visual impairment in the past years and over articles on solving the problem of navigation for people who are blind or visually impaired as well over articles on augmented reality and visual impairment have appeared in the engineering literature since most of these articles were published within the past years and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year gps accelerometers gyroscopes and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what in the immediate vicinity and assistance in getting to destination wearable technology wearable technology are smart electronic devices that can be worn on the body as an implant or an accessory new technologies are exploring how the visually impaired can receive visual information through wearable devices some wearable devices for visual impairment include orcam device esight brainport personal emergency response systems this voter with manual dexterity disability is making choices on touchscreen with head dauber personal emergency response systems pers or telecare uk term are particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer an example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors thermometers for hypothermia risk flooding and unlit gas sensors for people with mild dementia notably these alerts can be customized to the particular person risks when the alert is triggered message is sent to caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately accessibility software in human computer interaction computer accessibility also known as accessible computing refers to the accessibility of computer system to all people regardless of disability or severity of impairment examples include web accessibility guidelines another approach is for the user to present token to the computer terminal such as smart card that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed text size etc to their particular needs this is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in libraries atm information kiosks etc the concept is encompassed by the cen en identification card systems man machine interface this development of this standard has been supported in europe by snapi and has been successfully incorporated into the lasseo specifications but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers hearing impairments people in the deaf and hard of hearing community have more difficult time receiving auditory information as compared to hearing individuals these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information the use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to auditory communication needs by providing higher sound for those who are hard of hearing tactile feedback visual cues and improved technology access individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing utilize variety of assistive technologies that provide them with different access to information in numerous environments most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and or vibration these technologies can be grouped into three general categories hearing technology alerting devices and communication support hearing aids hearing aid or deaf aid is an electro acoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry this type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their hearing communities by allowing them to hear more clearly they amplify any and all sound waves through use of microphone amplifier and speaker there is wide variety of hearing aids available including digital in the ear in the canal behind the ear and on the body aids assistive listening devices assistive listening devices include fm infrared and loop assistive listening devices this type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions making places like auditoriums classrooms and meetings much easier to participate in the assistive listening device usually uses microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an fm frequency modulation transmission ir infra red transmission il induction loop transmission or other transmission methods the person who is listening may use an fm ir il receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his her preferred volume amplified telephone equipment this type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can easily partake in this medium of communication there are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of call to suit their individual hearing needs additionally there is wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from with different degrees of amplification for example phone with to decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss while phone with to decibel is better for more severe hearing loss augmentative and alternative communication an aac user uses number coding on an eye gaze communication board augmentative and alternative communication aac is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language aac systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user they may be as basic as pictures on board that are used to request food drink or other care or they can be advanced speech generating devices based on speech synthesis that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words cognitive impairments assistive technology for cognition atc is the use of technology usually high tech to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention memory self regulation navigation emotion recognition and management planning and sequencing activity systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of atc are growing rapidly but have focused on memory and planning that there is emerging evidence for efficacy that lot of scope exists to develop new atc examples of atc include neuropage which prompts users about meetings wakamaru which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong and telephone reassurance systems memory aids memory aids are any type of assistive technology that helps user learn and remember certain information many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading writing or organizational difficulties for example smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both digital copy and an audio recording of the text users simply tap certain parts of their notes the pen saves it and reads it back to them from there the user can also download their notes onto computer for increased accessibility digital voice recorders are also used to record in the moment information for fast and easy recall at later time educational software educational software is software that assists people with reading learning comprehension and organizational difficulties any accommodation software such as text readers notetakers text enlargers organization tools word predictions and talking word processors falls under the category of educational software eating impairments adaptive eating devices include items commonly used by the general population like spoons and forks and plates however they become assistive technology when they are modified to accommodate the needs of people who have difficulty using standard cutlery due to disabling condition common modifications include increasing the size of the utensil handle to make it easier to grasp plates and bowls may have guard on the edge that stops food being pushed off of the dish when it is being scooped more sophisticated equipment for eating includes manual and powered feeding devices these devices support those who have little or no hand and arm function and enable them to eat independently in sports new york city marathon competitor uses racing wheelchair assistive technology in sports is an area of technology design that is growing assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play assistive technology may be used in adaptive sports where an existing sport is modified to enable players with disability to participate or assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind an increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports leading to the development of new assistive technology assistive technology devices can be simple or low tech or they may use highly advanced technology low tech devices can include velcro gloves and adaptive bands and tubes high tech devices can include all terrain wheelchairs and adaptive bicycles accordingly assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite paralympic games more complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time and as result sports for people with disabilities have changed from being clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition oriented activity in education in the united states there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system the first is section of the rehabilitation act of and the second being the individuals with disabilities education act idea which was first enacted in under the name the education for all handicapped children act in during the reauthorization period for idea the national instructional material access center nimac was created which provided repository of accessible text including publisher textbooks to students with qualifying disability files provided are in xml format and used as starting platform for braille readers screen readers and other digital text software idea defines assistive technology as follows any item piece of equipment or product system whether acquired commercially off the shelf modified or customized that is used to increase maintain or improve functional capabilities of child with disability exception the term does not include medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device assistive technology in this area is broken down into low mid and high tech categories low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing high tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding word prediction for spelling and speech to text supports for reading include the use of text to speech tts software and font modification via access to digital text limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using mathml and daisy computer accessibility sip and puff device which allows person with substantial disability to make selections and navigate computerized interfaces by controlling inhalations and exhalations one of the largest problems that affect people with disabilities is discomfort with prostheses an experiment performed in massachusetts utilized people with various sensors attached to their arms the subjects tried different arm exercises and the sensors recorded their movements all of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts for prosthetics assistive technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as dvorak and other alternative keyboard layouts which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys assistive technology devices have been created to enable people with disabilities to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the ipad iphone and ipod touch the pererro is plug and play adapter for ios devices which uses the built in apple voiceover feature in combination with basic switch this brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it apple with the release of ios had introduced the ability to navigate apps using switch control switch access could be activated either through an external bluetooth connected switch single touch of the screen or use of right and left head turns using the device camera additional accessibility features include the use of assistive touch which allows user to access multi touch gestures through pre programmed onscreen buttons for users with physical disabilities large variety of switches are available and customizable to the user needs varying in size shape or amount of pressure required for activation switch access may be placed near any area of the body which has consistent and reliable mobility and less subject to fatigue common sites include the hands head and feet eye gaze and head mouse systems can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation user may utilize single or multiple switch sites and the process often involves scanning through items on screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted home automation the form of home automation called assistive domotics focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently home automation is becoming viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to healthcare facility this field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security entertainment and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users for example automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre recorded audio messages an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door impacts overall assistive technology aims to allow people with disabilities to participate more fully in all aspects of life home school and community and increases their opportunities for education social interactions and potential for meaningful employment it creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals for example in one study of infants toddlers and preschoolers all with some kind of developmental physical sensory or cognitive disability the use of assistive technology created improvements in child development these included improvements in cognitive social communication literacy motor adaptive and increases in engagement in learning activities additionally it has been found to lighten caregiver load both family and professional caregivers benefit from assistive technology through its use the time that family member or friend would need to care for patient significantly decreases however studies show that care time for professional caregiver increases when assistive technology is used nonetheless their work load is significantly easier as the assistive technology frees them of having to perform certain tasks there are several platforms that use machine learning to identify the appropriate assistive device to suggest to patients making assistive devices more accessible see also accessibility assisted living augmentative and alternative communication braille

chinese abacus suanpan calculating table by gregor reisch margarita philosophica the woodcut shows arithmetica instructing an algorist and an abacist inaccurately represented as boethius and pythagoras there was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the algebra into europe in the th century until its triumph in the th the abacus plural abaci or abacuses also called counting frame is calculating tool that was in use in the ancient near east europe china and russia centuries before the adoption of the written arabic numeral system the exact origin of the abacus is still unknown the abacus essentially consists of number of rows of movable beads or other objects which represent digits one of two numbers is set up and the beads are manipulated to implement an operation involving second number addition or rarely square or cubic root in earliest use the rows of beads could be loose on flat surface or sliding in grooves later the beads were made to slide on rods of some sort built into frame allowing faster manipulation abacuses are still made often as bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires in the ancient world particularly before the introduction of positional notation abacuses were practical calculating tool there are distinctive modern implementations of the abacus some designs like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens are used mainly to teach arithmetic although they remain popular in the post soviet states as tool other designs such as the japanese soroban have been used for practical calculations even involving numbers of several digits for any particular abacus design there are usually numerous different methods to perform calculations which may include the four basic operations and also square and cube roots some of these methods work with non natural numbers numbers such as and although today calculators and computers are usually used instead of abacuses abacuses still remain in common use in some countries merchants traders and clerks in some parts of eastern europe russia china and africa use abacuses and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children some people who are unable to use calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus etymology the use of the word abacus dates from before ad when middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe sandboard abacus the latin word came from ancient greek abax which means something without base and improperly any piece of rectangular board or plank alternatively without reference to ancient texts on etymology it has been suggested that it means square tablet strewn with dust or drawing board covered with dust for the use of mathematics the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word abakos while the table strewn with dust definition is popular some disagree saying that it is not proven greek itself is probably borrowing of northwest semitic language perhaps phoenician and cognate with the hebrew word ʾābāq or dust in post biblical sense meaning sand used as writing surface both abacuses and abaci soft or hard are used as plurals the user of an abacus is called an abacist history mesopotamian the period bc saw the first appearance of the sumerian abacus table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system some scholars point to character in babylonian cuneiform which may have been derived from representation of the abacus it is the belief of old babylonian scholars such as carruccio that old babylonians may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction however this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations egyptian the use of the abacus in ancient egypt is mentioned by the greek historian herodotus who writes that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left opposite in direction to the greek left to right method archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters however wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered persian during the achaemenid empire around bc the persians first began to use the abacus under the parthian sassanian and iranian empires scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them india china and the roman empire when it is thought to have been exported to other countries greek an early photograph of the salamis tablet the original is marble and is held by the national museum of epigraphy in athens the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the th century bc also demosthenes bc bc talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head play by alexis from the th century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting and both diogenes and polybius mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less like the pebbles on an abacus the greek abacus was table of wood or marble pre set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations this greek abacus saw use in achaemenid persia the etruscan civilization ancient rome and until the french revolution the western christian world tablet found on the greek island salamis in ad the salamis tablet dates back to bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far it is slab of white marble long wide and thick on which are groups of markings in the center of the tablet is set of parallel lines equally divided by vertical line capped with semicircle at the intersection of the bottom most horizontal line and the single vertical line below these lines is wide space with horizontal crack dividing it below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by line perpendicular to them but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with cross where they intersect with the vertical line also from this time frame the darius vase was unearthed in it was covered with pictures including treasurer holding wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on table with the other chinese chinese abacus suanpan the number represented in the picture is the earliest known written documentation of the chinese abacus dates to the nd century bc the chinese abacus known as the suanpan 算盤 算盘 lit calculating tray is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator it usually has more than seven rods there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom the beads are usually rounded and made of hardwood the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam beads moved toward the beam are counted while those moved away from it are not one of the top beads is while one of the bottom beads is each rod has number under it showing the place value the suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center the prototype of the chinese abacus appeared during the han dynasty and the beads are oval the song dynasty and earlier used the type or four beads abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as japanese style abacus in the early ming dynasty the abacus began to appear in the form of abacus the upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads in the late ming dynasty the abacus styles appeared in the form of the upper deck had two beads and the bottom had five beads various calculation techniques were devised for suanpan enabling efficient calculations there are currently schools teaching students how to use it in the long scroll along the river during the qingming festival painted by zhang zeduan during the song dynasty suanpan is clearly visible beside an account book and doctor prescriptions on the counter of an apothecary feibao the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other as there is some evidence of trade relationship between the roman empire and china however no direct connection can be demonstrated and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand where the roman model like most modern korean and japanese has plus bead per decimal place the standard suanpan has plus incidentally this allows use with hexadecimal numeral system or any base up to which may have been used for traditional chinese measures of weight instead of running on wires as in the chinese korean and japanese models the beads of roman model run in grooves presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower another possible source of the suanpan is chinese counting rods which operated with decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as place holder the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians roman copy of roman abacus the normal method of calculation in ancient rome as in greece was by moving counters on smooth table originally pebbles calculi were used later and in medieval europe jetons were manufactured marked lines indicated units fives tens etc as in the roman numeral system this system of counter casting continued into the late roman empire and in medieval europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century due to pope sylvester ii reintroduction of the abacus with modifications it became widely used in europe once again during the th century this abacus used beads on wires unlike the traditional roman counting boards which meant the abacus could be used much faster writing in the st century bc horace refers to the wax abacus board covered with thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using stylus one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus shown here in reconstruction dates to the st century ad it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each the groove marked indicates units tens and so on up to millions the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives five units five tens etc essentially in bi quinary coded decimal system related to the roman numerals the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces fractions indian the of vasubandhu sanskrit work on buddhist philosophy says that the second century ce philosopher vasumitra said that placing wick sanskrit vartikā on the number one ekāṅka means it is one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called hundred and on the number one thousand means it is thousand it is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been around the th century indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus hindu texts used the term śūnya zero to indicate the empty column on the abacus japanese japanese soroban in japanese the abacus is called soroban lit counting tray imported from china in the th century it was probably in use by the working class century or more before the ruling class started as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class the abacus which removes the seldom used second and fifth bead became popular in the today japanese abacus is type four bead abacus was introduced from china in the muromachi era it adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads the top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the chinese or korean abacus and the decimal number can be expressed so the abacus is designed as one four abacus the beads are always in the shape of diamond the quotient division is generally used instead of the division method at the same time in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication later japan had abacus called 天三算盤 which is now the ize rongji collection of shansi village in yamagata city there were also type abacus with the four bead abacus spread it is also common to use japanese abacus around the world there are also improved japanese abacus in various places one of the japanese made abacus made in china is an aluminum frame plastic bead abacus the file is next to the four beads and the clearing button press the clearing button immediately put the upper bead to the upper position the lower bead is dialed to the lower position immediately clearing easy to use the abacus is still manufactured in japan today even with the proliferation practicality and affordability of pocket electronic calculators the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary schools as part of mathematics primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation using visual imagery of soroban one can arrive at the answer in the same time as or even faster than is possible with physical instrument korean the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around ad koreans call it jupan 주판 supan 수판 or jusan 주산 the four beads abacus was introduced to korea goryeo dynasty from the china during song dynasty later the five beads abacus abacus was introduced to korean from china during the ming dynasty native american representation of an inca quipu yupana as used by the incas some sources mention the use of an abacus called in ancient aztec culture this mesoamerican abacus used digit base system the word comes from nahuatl and it is formed by the roots ne personal pōhual or pōhualli the account and tzintzin small similar elements its complete meaning was taken as counting with small similar elements by somebody its use was taught in the calmecac to the temalpouhqueh who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies from childhood the was divided in two main parts separated by bar or intermediate cord in the left part there were four beads which in the first row have unitary values and and in the right side there are three beads with values of and respectively in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows it is enough to multiply by by each row the value of the corresponding account in the first row altogether there were rows with beads in each one which made up beads in each this was basic number to understand times close relation conceived between natural phenomena the underworld and the cycles of the heavens one represented the number of days that season of the year lasts two nepōhualtzitzin is the number of days of the corn cycle from its sowing to its harvest three is the number of days of baby gestation and four completed cycle and approximate year days short when translated into modern computer arithmetic the amounted to the rank from to the in floating point which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision meant that no round off was allowed the rediscovery of the was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo who in his wanderings throughout mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold jade encrustations of shell etc there have also been found very old attributed to the olmec culture and even some bracelets of mayan origin as well as diversity of forms and materials in other cultures george sanchez arithmetic in maya austin texas found another base base abacus in the yucatán peninsula that also computed calendar data this was finger abacus on one hand and were used and on the other hand and were used note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles sanchez worked with sylvanus morley noted mayanist the quipu of the incas was system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data like advanced tally sticks but not used to perform calculations calculations were carried out using yupana quechua for counting tool see figure which was still in use after the conquest of peru the working principle of yupana is unknown but in an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by italian mathematician nicolino de pasquale by comparing the form of several yupanas researchers found that calculations were based using the fibonacci sequence and powers of and as place values for the different fields in the instrument using the fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at minimum russian russian abacus the russian abacus the schoty plural from counting usually has single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire usually positioned near the user with four beads for quarter ruble fractions older models have another bead wire for quarter kopeks which were minted until the russian abacus is often used vertically with each wire from left to right like lines in book the wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right during manipulation beads are moved to the left for easy viewing the middle beads on each wire the th and th bead usually are of different color from the other eight beads likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have different color as simple cheap and reliable device the russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the former soviet union and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the even the invention of mechanical calculator odhner arithmometer had not replaced them in russia according to yakov perelman even in his times some businessmen attempting to import such devices into the russian empire were known to give up and leave in despair after being shown the work of skilled abacus operator likewise the mass production of felix arithmometers since did not significantly reduce their use in the soviet union the russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of had started in the soviet union in today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator the russian abacus was brought to france around by the mathematician jean victor poncelet who served in napoleon army and had been prisoner of war in russia the abacus had fallen out of use in western europe in the th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods to poncelet french contemporaries it was something new poncelet used it not for any applied purpose but as teaching and demonstration aid the turks and the armenian people also used abacuses similar to the russian schoty it was named coulba by the turks and choreb by the armenians school abacus early th century abacus used in danish elementary school twenty bead rekenrek around the world abacuses have been used in pre schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic in western countries bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and vertical frame has been common see image it is still often seen as plastic or wooden toy the wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses thus the wire version may represent numbers up to or each bead may represent one unit so that can be represented by shifting all beads on wires and beads on the th wire so numbers up to may be represented in the bead frame shown the gap between the th and th wire corresponding to the color change between the th and the th bead on each wire suggests the latter use teaching multiplication times may be represented by shifting beads on wires the red and white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for wide range of number related lessons the twenty bead version referred to by its dutch name rekenrek calculating frame is often used sometimes on string of beads sometimes on rigid framework speed eminent physicist richard feynman was noted for expertise in mathematical calculations he wrote about an encounter in brazil with japanese abacus expert who challenged him to speed contests between feynman pen and paper and the abacus the abacus was much faster for addition somewhat faster for multiplication but feynman was faster at division when the abacus was used for really difficult challenge cube roots feynman won easily but by fluke as the number chosen at random was close to number feynman happened to know was an exact cube allowing approximate methods to be used neurological analysis by learning how to calculate with abacus one can improve one mental calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing large number calculations abacus based mental calculation amc was derived from the abacus which means doing calculation including addition subtraction multiplication and division in mind with an imagined abacus it is high level cognitive skill that runs through calculations with an effective algorithm people doing long term amc training show higher numerical memory capacity and have more effectively connected neural pathways they are able to retrieve memory to deal with complex processes to calculate the processing of amc involves both the visuospatial and visuomotor processing which generate the visual abacus and perform the movement of the imaginary bead since the only thing needed to be remembered is the final position of beads it takes less memory and less computation time renaissance

zinc typical metal reacting with hydrochloric acid typical acid an acid is molecule or ion capable of donating proton hydrogen ion brønsted lowry acid or alternatively capable of forming covalent bond with an electron pair lewis acid the first category of acids are the proton donors or brønsted lowry acids in the special case of aqueous solutions proton donors form the hydronium ion and are known as arrhenius acids brønsted and lowry generalized the arrhenius theory to include non aqueous solvents brønsted or arrhenius acid usually contains hydrogen atom bonded to chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide practical description of an acid acids form aqueous solutions with sour taste can turn blue litmus red and react with bases and certain metals like calcium to form salts the word acid is derived from the latin acidus acēre meaning sour an aqueous solution of an acid has ph less than and is colloquially also referred to as acid as in dissolved in acid while the strict definition refers only to the solute lower ph means higher acidity and thus higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes acetic acid vinegar is dilute aqueous solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car batteries and citric acid found in citrus fruits as these examples show acids in the colloquial sense can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from acids in the strict sense that are solids liquids or gases strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid the second category of acids are lewis acids which form covalent bond with an electron pair an example is boron trifluoride bf whose boron atom has vacant orbital which can form covalent bond by sharing lone pair of electrons on an atom in base for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia nh lewis considered this as generalization of the brønsted definition so that an acid is chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons into the solution which then accept electron pairs however hydrogen chloride acetic acid and most other brønsted lowry acids cannot form covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not lewis acids conversely many lewis acids are not arrhenius or brønsted lowry acids in modern terminology an acid is implicitly brønsted acid and not lewis acid since chemists almost always refer to lewis acid explicitly as lewis acid definitions and concepts modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water so the arrhenius and brønsted lowry definitions are the most relevant the brønsted lowry definition is the most widely used definition unless otherwise specified acid base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of proton from an acid to base hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions although alcohols and amines can be brønsted lowry acids they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms arrhenius acids svante arrhenius in svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions later described as protons or hydrons an arrhenius acid is substance that when added to water increases the concentration of ions in the water note that chemists often write aq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion or other forms thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hydrogen chloride and acetic acid an arrhenius base on the other hand is substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide oh ions when dissolved in water this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form molecules oh due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases it in an acidic solution the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than moles per liter since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acidic solutions thus have ph of less than brønsted lowry acids acetic acid weak acid donates proton hydrogen ion highlighted in green to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the acetate ion and the hydronium ion red oxygen black carbon white hydrogen while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope in chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acid base reactions involve the transfer of proton brønsted lowry acid or simply brønsted acid is species that donates proton to brønsted lowry base brønsted lowry acid base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of acetic acid ch cooh the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste both theories easily describe the first reaction ch cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as source of when dissolved in water and it acts as brønsted acid by donating proton to water in the second example ch cooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating proton to ammonia nh but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium nevertheless ch cooh is both an arrhenius and brønsted lowry acid brønsted lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of molecular compounds in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase hydrogen chloride hcl and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride nh cl in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrhenius definition cl nh cl nh aq hcl benzene nh benzene nh cl hcl nh nh cl as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia dissolved in benzene react to form solid ammonium chloride in benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh combine to form the solid lewis acids third only marginally related concept was proposed in by gilbert lewis which includes reactions with acid base characteristics that do not involve proton transfer lewis acid is species that accepts pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor brønsted acid base reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acid base reactions are electron pair transfers many lewis acids are not brønsted lowry acids contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid base chemistry px in the first reaction fluoride ion gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product fluoride loses pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion bf is lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride this reaction cannot be described in terms of brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer the second reaction can be described using either theory proton is transferred from an unspecified brønsted acid to ammonia brønsted base alternatively ammonia acts as lewis base and transfers lone pair of electrons to form bond with hydrogen ion the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid for example the oxygen atom in gains pair of electrons when one of the bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen depending on the context lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile organic brønsted acids such as acetic citric or oxalic acid are not lewis acids they dissociate in water to produce lewis acid but at the same time also yield an equal amount of lewis base acetate citrate or oxalate respectively for the acids mentioned few if any of the acids discussed in the following are lewis acids dissociation and equilibrium reactions of acids are often generalized in the form ha where ha represents the acid and is the conjugate base this reaction is referred to as protolysis the protonated form ha of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid acid base conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of proton protonation and deprotonation respectively note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as ha in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base the equilibrium constant is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution brackets indicate concentration such that means the concentration of the acid dissociation constant is generally used in the context of acid base reactions the numerical value of is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid ha and the products are the conjugate base and the stronger of two acids will have higher than the weaker acid the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has greater tendency to lose its proton because the range of possible values for spans many orders of magnitude more manageable constant is more frequently used where log stronger acids have smaller than weaker acids experimentally determined at in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material nomenclature arrhenius acids are named according to their anions in the classical naming system the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with new suffix according to the table following the prefix hydro is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the hydro prefix is used and the ide suffix makes the name take the form hydrochloric acid classical naming system anion prefix anion suffix acid prefix acid suffix example per ate per ic acid perchloric acid hclo ate ic acid chloric acid hclo ite ous acid chlorous acid hclo hypo ite hypo ous acid hypochlorous acid hclo ide hydro ic acid hydrochloric acid hcl in the iupac naming system aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound thus for hydrogen chloride as an acid solution the iupac name is aqueous hydrogen chloride acid strength the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose proton strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water in other words one mole of strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of and one mole of the conjugate base and none of the protonated acid ha in contrast weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid hcl hydroiodic acid hi hydrobromic acid hbr perchloric acid hclo nitric acid hno and sulfuric acid so in water each of these essentially ionizes the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses proton two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the bond and the size of atom which determines the strength of the bond acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base stronger acids have larger and more negative than weaker acids sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are class of strong acids common example is toluenesulfonic acid tosylic acid unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable superacids are acids stronger than sulfuric acid examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations while measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution the ph of simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound lewis acid strength in non aqueous solutions lewis acids have been classified in the ecw model and it has been shown that there is no one order of acid strengths the relative acceptor strength of lewis acids toward series of bases versus other lewis acids can be illustrated by plots it has been shown that to define the order of lewis acid strength at least two properties must be considered for pearson qualitative hsab theory the two properties are hardness and strength while for drago quantitative ecw model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent chemical characteristics monoprotic acids monoprotic acids also known as monobasic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation sometimes called ionization as shown below symbolized by ha ha aq common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid examples in organic acids include formic acid hcooh acetic acid ch cooh and benzoic acid cooh polyprotic acids polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic or dibasic acid two potential protons to donate and triprotic or tribasic acid three potential protons to donate diprotic acid here symbolized by can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka and ka the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second for example sulfuric acid so can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion hso for which is very large then it can donate second proton to form the sulfate anion so wherein the is intermediate strength the large for the first dissociation makes sulfuric strong acid in similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion and lose second to form carbonate anion co both values are small but triprotic acid can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where an inorganic example of triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid po usually just called phosphoric acid all three protons can be successively lost to yield po then hpo and finally po the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged an organic example of triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution the fractional concentration alpha for each species can be calculated for example generic diprotic acid will generate species in solution ha and the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph which can be converted to the or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given and is known as bjerrum plot pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general protic acid that has been deprotonated times where and the other terms are the dissociation constants for the acid neutralization hydrochloric acid in beaker reacting with ammonia fumes to produce ammonium chloride white smoke neutralization is the reaction between an acid and base producing salt and neutralized base for example hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water hcl aq naoh aq nacl aq neutralization is the basis of titration where ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of base have been added to an acid it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in solution with ph which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during reaction neutralization with base weaker than the acid results in weakly acidic salt an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia conversely neutralizing weak acid with strong base gives weakly basic salt sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide weak acid weak base equilibrium in order for protonated acid to lose proton the ph of the system must rise above the of the acid the decreased concentration of in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form the deprotonated form of the acid in lower ph more acidic solutions there is high enough concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions titration to determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution an acid base titration is commonly performed strong base solution with known concentration usually naoh or koh is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added the titration curve of an acid titrated by base has two axes with the base volume on the axis and the solution ph value on the axis the ph of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution example diprotic acid this is an ideal titration curve for alanine diprotic amino acid point is the first equivalent point where the amount of naoh added equals the amount of alanine in the original solution for each diprotic acid titration curve from left to right there are two midpoints two equivalence points and two buffer regions equivalence points due to the successive dissociation processes there are two equivalence points in the titration curve of diprotic acid the first equivalence point occurs when all first hydrogen ions from the first ionization are titrated in other words the amount of oh added equals the original amount of at the first equivalence point the second equivalence point occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated therefore the amount of oh added equals twice the amount of at this time for weak diprotic acid titrated by strong base the second equivalence point must occur at ph above due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution at either equivalence point adding drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the ph value in the system buffer regions and midpoints titration curve for diprotic acid contains two midpoints where ph pka since there are two different ka values the first midpoint occurs at ph pka and the second one occurs at ph pka each segment of the curve which contains midpoint at its center is called the buffer region because the buffer regions consist of the acid and its conjugate base it can resist ph changes when base is added until the next equivalent points applications of acids acids exist universally in our life there are both numerous kinds of natural acid compounds with biological functions and massive synthesized acids which are used in many ways in industry acids are fundamental reagents in treating almost all processes in today industry sulfuric acid diprotic acid is the most widely used acid in industry which is also the most produced industrial chemical in the world it is mainly used in producing fertilizer detergent batteries and dyes as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities according to the statistics data in the annual production of sulfuric acid was around million tonnes in the world for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts for example nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate fertilizer additionally carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols to produce esters acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in process known as pickling they may be used as an electrolyte in wet cell battery such as sulfuric acid in car battery in food carbonated water co aqueous solution is commonly added to soft drinks to make them effervesce tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids citric acid is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits oxalic acid is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in carambola and rhubarb rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid ascorbic acid vitamin is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla indian gooseberry lemon citrus fruits and guava many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives phosphoric acid for example is component of cola drinks acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar citric acid is used as preservative in sauces and pickles carbonic acid is one of the most common acid additives that are widely added in soft drinks during the manufacturing process co is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid carbonic acid is very unstable and tends to decompose into water and co at room temperature and pressure therefore when bottles or cans of these kinds of soft drinks are opened the soft drinks fizz and effervesce as co bubbles come out certain acids are used as drugs acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is used as pain killer and for bringing down fevers in human bodies acids play important roles in the human body the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body human bodies contain variety of organic and inorganic compounds among those dicarboxylic acids play an essential role in many biological behaviors many of those acids are amino acids which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the body ph from undergoing large scale changes which would be harmful to cells the rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies acid catalysis acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry for example sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline some acids such as sulfuric phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions in biochemistry many enzymes employ acid catalysis biological occurrence basic structure of an amino acid many biologically important molecules are acids nucleic acids which contain acidic phosphate groups include dna and rna nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism characteristics and is passed from parents to offspring dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids an amino acid has central carbon the or alpha carbon which is covalently bonded to carboxyl group thus they are carboxylic acids an amino group hydrogen atom and variable group the variable group also called the group or side chain determines the identity and many of the properties of specific amino acid in glycine the simplest amino acid the group is hydrogen atom but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens and may contain other elements such as sulfur oxygen or nitrogen with the exception of glycine naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the configuration peptidoglycan found in some bacterial cell walls contains some amino acids at physiological ph typically around free amino acids exist in charged form where the acidic carboxyl group cooh loses proton coo and the basic amine group nh gains proton nh the entire molecule has net neutral charge and is zwitterion with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains aspartic acid for example possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups for net charge of at physiological ph fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play significant role in biology these contain long hydrocarbon chains and carboxylic acid group on one end the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of phospholipid bilayer micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups membranes contain additional components some of which can participate in acid base reactions in humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides as well as converting the inactive pro enzyme pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin some organisms produce acids for defense for example ants produce formic acid acid base equilibrium plays critical role in regulating mammalian breathing oxygen gas drives cellular respiration the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food producing carbon dioxide co as byproduct oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation for example during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat releasing co into the blood stream in aqueous solutions such as blood co exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion co co hco it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper expelling the excess co and resupplying the cells with aspirin acetylsalicylic acid is carboxylic acid cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior many biologically important molecules including number of pharmaceutical agents are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated uncharged form but not in their charged form as the conjugate base for this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods the charged form however is often more soluble in blood and cytosol both aqueous environments when the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral ph within the cell certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer acids that lose proton at the intracellular ph will exist in their soluble charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target ibuprofen aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids common acids mineral acids inorganic acids hydrogen halides and their solutions hydrofluoric acid hf

natural bitumen from the dead sea refined asphalt the university of queensland pitch drop experiment demonstrating the viscosity of asphalt asphalt also known as bitumen is sticky black highly viscous liquid or semi solid form of petroleum it may be found in natural deposits or may be refined product and is classed as pitch before the th century the term asphaltum was also used the word is derived from the ancient greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos the pitch lake is the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world estimated to contain million tons it is located in la brea in southwest trinidad within the siparia regional corporation the primary use of asphalt is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs in material sciences and engineering the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance although there is regional variation as to which term is most common worldwide geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material for the manufactured material which is refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world however in american english asphalt is more commonly used to help avoid confusion the phrases liquid asphalt asphalt binder or asphalt cement are used in the colloquially various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar as in the name of the la brea tar pits although tar is different material naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen the canadian province of alberta has most of the world reserves of natural asphalt in the athabasca oil sands which cover an area larger than england asphalt properties change with temperature which means that there is specific range where viscosity permits adequate compaction by providing lubrication between particles during the compaction process low temperature prevents aggregate particles from moving and the required density is not possible to achieve computer simulations of simplified model systems are able to reproduce some of asphalt characteristic properties terminology etymology the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the greek ásphaltos ásphalton word meaning asphalt bitumen pitch which perhaps derives from not without the alpha privative and sphallein to cause to fall baffle in passive err in passive be balked of the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of cement for securing or joining together various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french asphalte and english asphaltum and asphalt in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphalt soaked limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads the expression bitumen originated in the sanskrit words jatu meaning pitch and jatu krit meaning pitch creating or pitch producing referring to coniferous or resinous trees the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu men pertaining to pitch and by others pixtumens exuding or bubbling pitch which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via french into english from the same root is derived the anglo saxon word cwidu mastix the german word kitt cement or mastic and the old norse word kvada modern terminology in british english bitumen is used instead of asphalt the word asphalt is instead used to refer to asphalt concrete mixture of construction aggregate and asphalt itself also called tarmac in common parlance bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum but the term is less commonly used today in australian english the word asphalt is used to describe mix of construction aggregate bitumen refers to the liquid derived from the heavy residues from crude oil distillation in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen however asphalt is also commonly used as shortened form of asphalt concrete therefore equivalent to the british asphalt or tarmac in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product diluted bitumen diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen is called synbit bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi solid form of petroleum bituminous rock is form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen the oil sands of alberta canada are similar material neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses whether fossilized as with coal or freshly harvested the majority of bitumen on the other hand was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenetic point where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined together in long chains in the absence of oxygen bitumen occurs as solid or highly viscous liquid it may even be mixed in with coal deposits bitumen and coal using the bergius process can be refined into petrols such as gasoline and bitumen may be distilled into tar not the other way around composition normal composition the components of asphalt include four main classes of compounds naphthene aromatics naphthalene consisting of partially hydrogenated polycyclic aromatic compounds polar aromatics consisting of high molecular weight phenols and carboxylic acids produced by partial oxidation of the material saturated hydrocarbons the percentage of saturated compounds in asphalt correlates with its softening point asphaltenes consisting of high molecular weight phenols and heterocyclic compounds the naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to nickel and vanadium are found at over minute period asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving roofing and other applications in examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt the international agency for research on cancer iarc determined that it is the application parameters predominantly temperature that affect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard risk of the asphalt emissions in particular temperatures greater than were shown to produce greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement iarc has classified paving asphalt fumes as class possible carcinogen indicating inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans in scientists reported that asphalt currently is significant and largely overlooked source of air pollution in urban areas especially during hot and sunny periods in india asphalt known as shilajit found in the himalayas is consumed by people and is considered to have medicinal properties according to ayurveda see

the american national standards institute ansi is private non profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products services processes systems and personnel in the united states the organization also coordinates standards with international standards so that american products can be used worldwide ansi accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organizations government agencies consumer groups companies and others these standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent that people use the same definitions and terms and that products are tested the same way ansi also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards the organization headquarters are in washington ansi operations office is located in new york city the ansi annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications membership dues and fees accreditation services fee based programs and international standards programs history ansi was originally formed in when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the american engineering standards committee aesc in the aesc became the american standards association asa in the asa was reorganized and became united states of america standards institute usasi the present name was adopted in prior to these five founding engineering societies american institute of electrical engineers aiee now ieee american society of

for testing and materials now astm international had been members of the united engineering society ues at the behest of the aiee they invited the government departments of war navy combined in to become the department of defense or dod and commerce to join in founding national standards organization according to adam stanton the first permanent secretary and head of staff in aesc started as an ambitious program and little else staff for the first year consisted of one executive clifford lepage who was on loan from founding member asme an annual budget of was provided by the founding bodies in the organization renamed asa in became affiliated with the national committee of the international commission iec which had been formed in to develop electrical and electronics standards members ansi members are government agencies organizations academic and international bodies and individuals in total the institute represents the interests of more than companies and organizations and million professionals worldwide process although ansi itself does not develop standards the institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations ansi accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the institute requirements for openness balance consensus and due process ansi also designates specific standards as american national standards or ans when the institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers there are approximately american national standards that carry the ansi designation the american national standards process involves consensus by group that is open to representatives from all interested parties broad based public review and comment on draft standards consideration of and response to comments incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into draft standard availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards development process international activities in addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the united states ansi promotes the use of standards internationally advocates policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate the institute is the official representative to the two major international standards organizations the international organization for standardization iso as founding member and the international commission iec via the national committee usnc ansi participates in almost the entire technical program of both the iso and the iec and administers many key committees and subgroups in many instances standards are taken forward to iso and iec through ansi or the usnc where they are

apollo was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the moon commander neil armstrong and lunar module pilot buzz aldrin formed the american crew that landed the apollo lunar module eagle on july at utc cst armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and minutes later on july at utc aldrin joined him minutes later they spent about two and quarter hours together outside the spacecraft and they collected of lunar material to bring back to earth command module pilot michael collins flew the command module columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the moon surface armstrong and aldrin spent hours minutes on the lunar surface at site they named tranquility base before lifting off to rejoin columbia in lunar orbit apollo was launched by saturn rocket from kennedy space center on merritt island florida on july at utc and it was the fifth crewed mission of nasa apollo program the apollo spacecraft had three parts command module cm with cabin for the three astronauts the only part that returned to earth service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and lunar module lm that had two stages descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit after being sent to the moon by the saturn third stage the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit armstrong and aldrin then moved into eagle and landed in the sea of tranquility on july the astronauts used eagle ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin collins in the command module they jettisoned eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled columbia out of the last of its lunar orbits onto trajectory back to earth they returned to earth and splashed down in the pacific ocean on july after more than eight days in space armstrong first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live tv to worldwide audience he described the event as one small step for man one giant leap for mankind apollo effectively ended the space race and fulfilled national goal proposed in by president john kennedy before this decade is out of landing man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth background in the late and early the united states was engaged in the cold war geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october the soviet union launched sputnik the first artificial satellite this surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world it demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over distances and challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority this precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president dwight eisenhower responded to the sputnik challenge by creating the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and initiating project mercury which aimed to launch man into earth orbit but on april soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person in space and the first to orbit the earth nearly month later on may alan shepard became the first american in space completing minute suborbital journey after being recovered from the atlantic ocean he received congratulatory telephone call from eisenhower successor john kennedy since the soviet union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles kennedy chose from among options presented by nasa challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry so that the us and soviet union would be starting from position of equality crewed mission to the moon would serve this purpose on may kennedy addressed the united states congress on urgent national needs and declared on september kennedy delivered another speech before crowd of about people in the rice university football stadium in houston texas widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows president john kennedy speaking at rice university on september in spite of that the proposed program faced the opposition of many americans and was dubbed moondoggle by norbert wiener mathematician at the massachusetts institute of technology the effort to land man on the moon already had name project apollo when kennedy met with nikita khrushchev the premier of the soviet union in june he proposed making the moon landing joint project but khrushchev did not take up the offer kennedy again proposed joint expedition to the moon in speech to the united nations general assembly on september the idea of joint moon mission was abandoned after kennedy death an early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and earth orbit rendezvous space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up in july nasa head james webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the apollo spacecraft would have three major parts command module cm with cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that returned to earth service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and lunar module lm that had two stages descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit this design meant the spacecraft could be launched by single saturn rocket that was then under development technologies and techniques required for apollo were developed by project gemini the apollo project was enabled by nasa adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology including metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors mosfets in the interplanetary monitoring platform imp and silicon integrated circuit ic chips in the apollo guidance computer agc project apollo was abruptly halted by the apollo fire on january in which astronauts gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee died and the subsequent investigation in october apollo evaluated the command module in earth orbit and in december apollo tested it in lunar orbit in march apollo put the lunar module through its paces in earth orbit and in may apollo conducted dress rehearsal in lunar orbit by july all was in readiness for apollo to take the final step onto the moon the soviet union competed with the us in the space race but its early lead was lost through repeated failures in development of the launcher which was comparable to the saturn the soviets tried to beat the us to return lunar material to the earth by means of uncrewed probes on july three days before apollo launch the soviet union launched luna which reached lunar orbit before apollo during descent malfunction caused luna to crash in mare crisium about two hours before armstrong and aldrin took off from the moon surface to begin their voyage home the nuffield radio astronomy laboratories radio telescope in england recorded transmissions from luna during its descent and these were released in july for the th anniversary of apollo personnel prime crew the initial crew assignment of commander neil armstrong command module pilot cmp jim lovell and lunar module pilot lmp buzz aldrin on the backup crew for apollo was officially announced on november lovell and aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of gemini due to design and manufacturing delays in the lm apollo and apollo swapped prime and backup crews and armstrong crew became the backup for apollo based on the normal crew rotation scheme armstrong was then expected to command apollo there would be one change michael collins the cmp on the apollo crew began experiencing trouble with his legs doctors diagnosed the problem as bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae requiring surgery lovell took his place on the apollo crew and when collins recovered he joined armstrong crew as cmp in the meantime fred haise filled in as backup lmp and aldrin as backup cmp for apollo apollo was the second american mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience the first being apollo the next was sts in deke slayton gave armstrong the option to replace aldrin with lovell since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with armstrong had no issues working with aldrin but thought it over for day before declining he thought lovell deserved to command his own mission eventually apollo the apollo prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of apollo instead they forged an amiable working relationship armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof but collins who considered himself loner confessed to rebuffing aldrin attempts to create more personal relationship aldrin and collins described the crew as amiable strangers armstrong did not agree with the assessment and said all the crews was on worked very well together backup crew the backup crew consisted of lovell as commander william anders as cmp and haise as lmp anders had flown with lovell on apollo in early he accepted job with the national aeronautics and space council effective august and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time ken mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with anders as backup cmp in case apollo was delayed past its intended july launch date at which point anders would be unavailable by the normal crew rotation in place during apollo lovell mattingly and haise were scheduled to fly on apollo after backing up for apollo later lovell crew was forced to switch places with alan shepard tentative apollo crew to give shepard more training time support crew during projects mercury and gemini each mission had prime and backup crew for apollo third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes they developed procedures especially those for emergency situations so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them for apollo the support crew consisted of ken mattingly ronald evans and bill pogue capsule communicators capcom charles duke left with backup crewmen jim lovell and fred haise listening in during apollo descent the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for apollo the capcoms were charles duke ronald evans bruce mccandless ii james lovell william anders ken mattingly fred haise don lind owen garriott and harrison schmitt flight directors the flight directors for this

john houbolt route planner gene shoemaker geologist who trained astronauts in field geology bill tindall coordinated mission techniques preparations insignia apollo insignia the apollo mission emblem was designed by collins who wanted symbol for peaceful lunar landing by the united states at lovell suggestion he chose the bald eagle the national bird of the united states as the symbol tom wilson simulator instructor suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission collins added lunar background with the earth in the distance the sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction the shadow should have been in the lower part of the earth instead of the left aldrin armstrong and collins decided the eagle and the moon would be in their natural colors and decided on blue and gold border armstrong was concerned that eleven would not be understood by non english speakers so they went with apollo and they decided not to put their names on the patch so it would be representative of everyone who had worked toward lunar landing an illustrator at the manned spacecraft center msc did the artwork which was then sent off to nasa officials for approval the design was rejected bob gilruth the director of the msc felt the talons of the eagle looked too warlike after some discussion the olive branch was moved to the talons when the eisenhower dollar coin was released in the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side the design was also used for the smaller susan anthony dollar unveiled in call signs after the crew of apollo named their spacecraft charlie brown and snoopy assistant manager for public affairs julian scheer wrote to george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office at the msc to suggest the apollo crew be less flippant in naming their craft the name snowcone was used for the cm and haystack was used for the lm in both internal and external communications during early mission planning the lm was named eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia at scheer suggestion the cm was named columbia after columbiad the giant cannon that launched spacecraft also from florida in jules verne novel from the earth to the moon it also referred to columbia historical name of the united states in collins book he said columbia was in reference to christopher columbus mementos robbins medallion the astronauts had personal preference kits ppks small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission five ppks were carried on apollo three one for each astronaut were stowed on columbia before launch and two on eagle neil armstrong lm ppk contained piece of wood from the wright brothers wright flyer left propeller and piece of fabric from its wing along with diamond studded astronaut pin originally given to slayton by the widows of the apollo crew this pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to slayton afterwards but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals the widows gave the pin to slayton armstrong took it with him on apollo site selection nasa apollo site selection board announced five potential landing sites on february these were the result of two years worth of studies based on high resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the lunar orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the surveyor program the best earth bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution project apollo required the landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar scientific value was not consideration areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on earth were often found to be totally unacceptable the original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed as no such site was found five sites were considered sites and were in the sea of tranquility mare tranquillitatis site was in the central bay sinus medii and sites and were in the ocean of storms oceanus procellarum the final site selection was based on seven criteria the site needed to be smooth with relatively few craters with approach paths free of large hills tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings reachable with minimum amount of propellant allowing for delays in the launch countdown providing the apollo spacecraft with free return trajectory one that would allow it to coast around the moon and safely return to earth without requiring any engine firings should problem arise on the way to the moon with good visibility during the landing approach meaning the sun would be between and degrees behind the lm and general slope of less than two degrees in the landing area the requirement for the sun angle was particularly restrictive limiting the launch date to one day per month landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience the apollo site selection board selected site with sites and as backups in the event of the launch being delayed in may apollo lunar module flew to within of site and reported it was acceptable first step decision during the first press conference after the apollo crew was announced the first question was which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface slayton told the reporter it had not been decided and armstrong added that it was not based on individual desire one of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander which matched what had been done on gemini missions where the commander had never performed the spacewalk reporters wrote in early that aldrin would be the first man to walk on the moon and associate administrator george mueller told reporters he would be first as well aldrin heard that armstrong would be the first because armstrong was civilian which made aldrin livid aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first but they responded cynically about what they perceived as lobbying campaign attempting to stem conflict slayton told aldrin that armstrong would be first since he was the commander the decision was announced in press conference on april for decades aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module hatch location because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult the crew tried simulation in which aldrin left the spacecraft first but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress while this was enough for mission planners to make their decision aldrin and armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring slayton told armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first if he agreed armstrong said yes that the way to do it the media accused armstrong of exercising his commander prerogative to exit the spacecraft first chris kraft revealed in his autobiography that meeting occurred between gilruth slayton low and himself to make sure aldrin would not be the first to walk on the moon they argued that the first person to walk on the moon should be like charles lindbergh calm and quiet person they made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft pre launch saturn sa the rocket carrying the apollo spacecraft moves out of the vehicle assembly building towards launch complex the ascent stage of lm eagle arrived at the kennedy space center on january followed by the descent stage four days later and csm columbia on january there were several differences between eagle and apollo lm snoopy eagle had vhf radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their eva on the lunar surface lighter ascent engine more thermal protection on the landing gear and package of scientific experiments known as the early apollo scientific experiments package easep the only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch the csm was mated on january and moved from the operations and checkout building to the vehicle assembly building on april the ivb third stage of saturn as had arrived on january followed by the ii second stage on february ic first stage on february and the saturn instrument unit on february at on may the assembly departed the vehicle assembly building atop the crawler transporter bound for launch pad part of launch complex while apollo was still on its way to the moon countdown test commenced on june and concluded on july the launch complex was floodlit on the night of july when the crawler transporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area in the early hours of the morning the fuel tanks of the ii and ivb stages were filled with liquid hydrogen fueling was completed by three hours before launch launch operations were partly automated with programs written in the atoll programming language slayton roused the crew shortly after and they showered shaved and had the traditional pre flight breakfast of steak and eggs with slayton and the backup crew they then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen at they headed out to launch complex haise entered columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time along with technician he helped armstrong into the left hand couch at five minutes later collins joined him taking up his position on the right hand couch finally aldrin entered taking the center couch haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch the closeout crew sealed the hatch and the cabin was purged and pressurized the closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time the countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time over personnel were at the consoles in the firing room mission launch and flight to lunar orbit the apollo saturn space vehicle lifts off with astronauts neil armstrong michael collins and edwin aldrin jr at edt july from kennedy space center launch complex an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of apollo from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site dignitaries included the chief of staff of the united states army general william westmoreland four cabinet members state governors mayors ambassadors and congressmen vice president spiro agnew viewed the launch with former president lyndon johnson and his wife lady bird johnson around media representatives were present about two thirds were from the united states the rest came from other countries the launch was televised live in countries with an estimated million viewers in the united states alone millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts president richard nixon viewed the launch from his office in the white house with his nasa liaison officer apollo astronaut frank borman saturn as launched apollo on july at utc edt at seconds into the flight the launch vehicle began to roll into its flight azimuth of full shutdown of the first stage engines occurred about minutes and seconds into the mission followed by separation of the ic and ignition of the ii engines the second stage engines then cut off and separated at about minutes and seconds allowing the first ignition of the ivb engine few seconds later apollo entered near circular earth orbit at an altitude of by twelve minutes into its flight after one and half orbits second ignition of the ivb engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon with the trans lunar injection tli burn at utc about minutes later with collins in the left seat and at the controls the transposition docking and extraction maneuver was performed this involved separating columbia from the spent ivb stage turning around and docking with eagle still attached to the stage after the lm was extracted the combined spacecraft headed for the moon while the rocket stage flew on trajectory past the moon this was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft the earth or the moon slingshot effect from passing around the moon threw it into an orbit around the sun on july at utc apollo passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit in the thirty orbits that followed the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquility about southwest of the crater sabine the site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ranger and surveyor landers and the lunar orbiter mapping spacecraft and because it was unlikely to present major landing or eva challenges it lay about southeast of the surveyor landing site and southwest of ranger crash site lunar descent columbia in lunar orbit photographed from eagle alt the top of the silvery command module is seen over grey cratered lunar surface at utc on july aldrin and armstrong entered eagle and began the final preparations for lunar descent at eagle separated from columbia collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear was correctly deployed armstrong exclaimed the eagle has wings as the descent began armstrong and aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early and reported that they were long they would land miles west of their target point eagle was traveling too fast the problem could have been mascons concentrations of high mass that could have altered the trajectory flight director gene kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel or it could have been the result of eagle pirouette maneuver five minutes into the descent burn and above the surface of the moon the lm guidance computer lgc distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected and program alarms inside mission control center computer engineer jack garman told guidance officer steve bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew the program alarms indicated executive overflows meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them margaret hamilton the director of apollo flight computer programming at the mit charles stark draper laboratory later recalled eagle in lunar orbit photographed from columbia during the mission the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time software engineer don eyles concluded in guidance and control conference paper that the problem was due to hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed lm in apollo having the rendezvous radar on so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort should have been irrelevant to the computer but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up the extra spurious cycle stealing as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter caused the computer alarms landing landing on the moon july when armstrong again looked outside he saw that the computer landing target was in boulder strewn area just north and east of crater later determined to be west crater so he took semi automatic control armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high throughout the descent aldrin called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting eagle now above the surface armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site armstrong found clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it as he got closer now above the surface he discovered his new landing site had crater in it he cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground they were now from the surface with only seconds of propellant remaining lunar dust kicked up by the lm engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecraft motion some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud and armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft speed light informed aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from eagle footpads had touched the surface few moments before the landing and he said contact light armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engine own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode but he forgot three seconds later eagle landed and armstrong shut the engine down aldrin immediately said okay engine stop aca out of detent armstrong acknowledged out of detent auto aldrin continued mode control both auto descent engine command override off engine arm off is in west crater aca was the attitude control assembly the lm control stick output went to the lgc to command the reaction control system rcs jets to fire out of detent meant the stick had moved away from its centered position it was spring centered like the turn indicator in car lgc address contained the variable that indicated the lm had landed eagle landed at utc on sunday july with of usable fuel remaining information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the lm had enough fuel for another seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe but post mission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to seconds apollo landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions and the astronauts encountered premature low fuel warning this was later found to be the result of greater propellant slosh than expected uncovering fuel sensor on subsequent missions extra anti slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this armstrong acknowledged aldrin completion of the post landing checklist with engine arm is off before responding to the capcom charles duke with the words houston tranquility base here the eagle has landed armstrong unrehearsed change of call sign from eagle to tranquility base emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at mission control roger twan tranquility we copy you on the ground you got bunch of guys about to turn blue we re breathing again thanks lot view from the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro of apollo landing site two and half hours after landing before preparations began for the eva aldrin radioed to earth he then took communion privately at this time nasa was still fighting lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray hair who had objected to the apollo crew reading from the book of genesis demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space as such aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon aldrin was an elder at the webster presbyterian church and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church dean woodruff webster presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the sunday closest to july the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with five hour sleep period but they chose to begin preparations for the eva early thinking they would be unable to sleep lunar surface operations photograph of neil armstrong taken by buzz aldrin this is one of the few photographs of armstrong on the lunar surface most of the time he held the camera preparations for neil armstrong and buzz aldrin to walk on the moon began at these took longer than expected three and half hours instead of two during training on earth everything required had been neatly laid out in advance but on the moon the cabin contained large number of other items as well such as checklists food packets and tools six hours and thirty nine minutes after landing armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside and eagle was depressurized eagle hatch was opened at armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system plss some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress at armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface the remote control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet climbing down the nine rung ladder armstrong pulled ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly mesa folded against eagle side and activate the tv camera apollo used slow scan television tv incompatible with broadcast tv so it was displayed on special monitor and conventional tv camera viewed this monitor significantly reducing the quality of the picture the signal was received at goldstone in the united states but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek tracking station near canberra in australia minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive parkes radio telescope in australia despite some technical and weather difficulties ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least million people on earth copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re use at nasa the plaque left on the ladder of eagle while still on the ladder armstrong uncovered plaque mounted on the lm descent stage bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and president nixon the inscription read at the behest of the nixon administration to add reference to god nasa included the vague date as reason to include which stands for anno domini in the year of our lord although it should have been placed before the year not after after describing the surface dust as very fine grained and almost like powder at six and half hours after landing armstrong stepped off eagle footpad and declared that one small step for man one giant leap for mankind armstrong intended to say that one small step for man but the word is not audible in the transmission and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast when later asked about his quote armstrong said he believed he said for man and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the in square brackets one explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words for together another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to earth partly because of storms near parkes observatory more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the may have been spoken but obscured by static other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as face saving fabrication and that armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line about seven minutes after stepping onto the moon surface armstrong collected contingency soil sample using sample bag on stick he then folded the bag and tucked it into pocket on his right thigh this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm twelve minutes after the sample was collected he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made panoramic sweep then mounted it on tripod the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented tripping hazard throughout the eva still photography was accomplished with hasselblad camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on armstrong apollo space suit aldrin joined armstrong on the surface he described the view with the simple phrase magnificent desolation armstrong said moving in the lunar gravity one sixth of earth was even perhaps easier than the simulations it absolutely no trouble to walk around aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including two footed kangaroo hops the plss backpack created tendency to tip backward but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance loping became the preferred method of movement the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead the fine soil was quite slippery aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagle shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit but the helmet was warmer in sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow the mesa failed to provide stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits aldrin salutes the deployed united states flag on the lunar surface the astronauts planted the lunar flag assembly containing flag of the united states on the lunar surface in clear view of the tv camera aldrin remembered of all the jobs had to do on the moon the one wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising but the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole about into the hard lunar surface aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of tv viewers but he gave crisp west point salute before aldrin could take photo of armstrong with the flag president richard nixon spoke to them through telephone radio transmission which nixon called the most historic phone call ever made from the white house nixon originally had long speech prepared to read during the phone call but frank borman who was at the white house as nasa liaison during apollo convinced nixon to keep his words brief aldrin bootprint part of an experiment to test the properties of the lunar regolith they deployed the easep which included passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment then armstrong walked from the lm to snap photos at the rim of little west crater while aldrin collected two core samples he used the geologist hammer to pound in the tubes the only time the hammer was used on apollo but was unable to penetrate more than deep the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted minutes aldrin shoveled of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly two types of rocks were found in the geological samples basalt and breccia three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts armalcolite tranquillityite and pyroxferroite armalcolite was named after armstrong aldrin and collins all have subsequently been found on earth mission control used coded phrase to warn armstrong his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk mission control granted the astronauts minute extension in interview armstrong explained that nasa limited the first moonwalk time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts plss backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the moon lunar ascent aldrin entered eagle first with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor lec this proved to be an inefficient tool and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the lm by hand armstrong reminded aldrin of bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket and aldrin tossed the bag down armstrong then jumped onto the ladder third rung and climbed into the lm after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes an empty hasselblad camera and other equipment the hatch was closed again at they then pressurized the lm and settled down to sleep aldrin next to the passive seismic experiment package with eagle in the background presidential speech writer william safire had prepared an in event of moon disaster announcement for nixon to read in the event the apollo astronauts were stranded on the moon the remarks were in memo from safire to nixon white house chief of staff haldeman in which safire suggested protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such disaster according to the plan mission control would close down communications with the lm and clergyman would commend their souls to the deepest of the deep in public ritual likened to burial at sea the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brooke first world war poem the soldier while moving inside the cabin aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the moon there was concern this would prevent firing the engine stranding them on the moon felt tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch after more than hours on the lunar surface in addition to the scientific instruments the astronauts left behind an apollo mission patch in memory of astronauts roger chaffee gus grissom and edward white who died when their command module caught fire during test in january two memorial medals of soviet cosmonauts vladimir komarov and yuri gagarin who died in and respectively memorial bag containing gold replica of an olive branch as traditional symbol of peace and silicon message disk carrying the goodwill statements by presidents eisenhower kennedy johnson and nixon along with messages from leaders of countries around the world the disk also carries listing of the leadership of the us congress listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation and the names of nasa past and then current top management map showing landing site and photos taken after about seven hours of rest the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight two and half hours later at utc they lifted off in eagle ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag planted some from the descent stage whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple the ascent stage of the lm separated was concentrating on the computers and neil was studying the attitude indicator but looked up long enough to see the flag fall over subsequent apollo missions planted their flags farther from the lm columbia in lunar orbit during his day flying solo around the moon collins never felt lonely although it has been said not since adam has any human known such solitude collins felt very much part of the mission in his autobiography he wrote this venture has been structured for three men and consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two in the minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the earth while columbia passed round the far side of the moon the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness but rather awareness anticipation satisfaction confidence almost exultation one of collins first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground to give collins an idea where to look mission control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about off target each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site he tried in vain to find the module on his first orbits on the back side of the moon collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for armstrong and aldrin to return just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit mission control informed collins there was problem with the temperature of the coolant if it became too cold parts of columbia might freeze mission control advised him to assume manual control and implement environmental control system malfunction procedure instead collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again and carried on with normal housekeeping chores while keeping an eye on the temperature when columbia came back around to the near side of the moon again he was able to report that the problem had been resolved for the next couple of orbits he described his time on the back side of the moon as relaxing after aldrin and armstrong completed their eva collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous while the flight plan called for eagle to meet up with columbia collins was prepared for contingency in which he would fly columbia down to meet eagle return eagle ascent stage approaching columbia eagle rendezvoused with columbia at utc on july and the two docked at eagle ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at just before the apollo flight it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon later nasa reports mentioned that eagle orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface on july the last night before splashdown the three astronauts made television broadcast in which collins commented aldrin added armstrong concluded on the return to earth bearing at the guam tracking station failed potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the earth return regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director charles force had his ten year old son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease greg was later thanked by armstrong splashdown and quarantine columbia floats on the ocean as navy divers assist in retrieving the astronauts the aircraft carrier under the command of captain carl seiberlich was selected as the primary recovery ship prs for apollo on june replacing its sister ship the lph which had recovered apollo on may hornet was then at her home port of long beach california on reaching pearl harbor on july hornet embarked the sikorsky sh sea king helicopters of hs unit which specialized in recovery of apollo spacecraft specialized divers of udt detachment apollo man nasa recovery team and about media representatives to make room most of hornet air wing was left behind in long beach special recovery equipment was also loaded including boilerplate command module used for training on july with apollo still on the launch pad hornet departed pearl harbor for the recovery area in the central pacific in the vicinity of presidential party consisting of nixon borman secretary of state william rogers and national security advisor henry kissinger flew to johnston atoll on air force one then to the command ship in marine one after night on board they would fly to hornet in marine one for few hours of ceremonies on arrival aboard hornet the party was greeted by the commander in chief pacific command cincpac admiral john mccain jr and nasa administrator thomas paine who flew to hornet from pago pago in one of hornet carrier onboard delivery aircraft weather satellites were not yet common but us air force captain hank brandli had access to top secret spy satellite images he realized that storm front was headed for the apollo recovery area poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult and strong upper level winds which would have ripped their parachutes to shreds according to brandli posed serious threat to the safety of the mission brandli alerted navy captain willard houston jr the commander of the fleet weather center at pearl harbor who had the required security clearance on their recommendation rear admiral donald davis commander of manned spaceflight recovery forces pacific advised nasa to change the recovery area each man risking their careers new location was selected northeast this altered the flight plan different sequence of computer programs was used one never before attempted in conventional entry was followed by for skip out re entry and were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip in this case because they were extending the re entry but not actually skipping out was not invoked and instead led directly to the crew were also warned they would not be in full lift heads down attitude when they entered the first program acceleration subjected the astronauts to the second to before dawn on july hornet launched four sea king helicopters and three grumman tracers two of the were designated as air boss while the third acted as communications relay aircraft two of the sea kings carried divers and recovery equipment the third carried photographic equipment and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon at utc local time columbia drogue parachutes were deployed this was observed by the helicopters seven minutes later columbia struck the water forcefully east of wake island south of johnston atoll and from hornet at with seas and winds at from the east were reported under broken clouds at with visibility of at the recovery site reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported the conditions brandli and houston had predicted during splashdown columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts diver from the navy helicopter hovering above attached sea anchor to prevent it from drifting more divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction the divers then passed biological isolation garments bigs to the astronauts and assisted them into the life raft the possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote but nasa took precautions at the recovery site the astronauts were rubbed down with sodium hypochlorite solution and columbia wiped with betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present the astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter bigs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board hornet the raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk after touchdown on hornet at utc the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay where the astronauts walked the to the mobile quarantine facility mqf where they would begin the earth based portion of their days of quarantine this practice would continue for two more apollo missions apollo and apollo before the moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped nixon welcomed the astronauts back to earth he told them as result of what you ve done the world has never been closer together before after nixon departed hornet was brought alongside the columbia which was lifted aboard by the ship crane placed on dolly and moved next to the mqf it was then attached to the mqf with flexible tunnel allowing the lunar samples film data tapes and other items to be removed hornet returned to pearl harbor where the mqf was loaded onto lockheed starlifter and airlifted to the manned spacecraft center the astronauts arrived at the lunar receiving laboratory at utc on july columbia was taken to ford island for deactivation and its pyrotechnics made safe it was then taken to hickham air force base from whence it was flown to houston in douglas cargomaster reaching the lunar receiving laboratory on july in accordance with the extra terrestrial exposure law set of regulations promulgated by nasa on july to codify its quarantine protocol the astronauts continued in quarantine after three weeks in confinement first in the apollo spacecraft then in their trailer on hornet and finally in the lunar receiving laboratory the astronauts were given clean bill of health on august the interagency committee on back contamination met in atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts on those who had joined them in quarantine nasa physician william carpentier and mqf project engineer john hirasaki and on columbia itself loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study celebrations ticker tape parade in new york city on august the three astronauts rode in ticker tape parades in their honor in new york and chicago with an estimated six million attendees on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight attended by members of congress governors the chief justice of the united states and ambassadors from nations at the century plaza hotel nixon and agnew honored each astronaut with presentation of the presidential medal of freedom the three astronauts spoke before joint session of congress on september they presented two us flags one to the house of representatives and the other to the senate that they had carried with them to the surface of the moon the flag of american samoa on apollo is on display at the jean haydon museum in pago pago the capital of american samoa this celebration began day world tour that brought the astronauts to foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries the crew toured from september to november many nations honored the first human moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing apollo commemorative postage stamps or coins legacy cultural significance humans walking on the moon and returning safely to earth accomplished kennedy goal set eight years earlier in mission control during the apollo landing kennedy speech flashed on the screen followed by the words task accomplished july the success of apollo demonstrated the united states technological superiority and with the success of apollo america had won the space race new phrases permeated into the english language if they can send man to the moon why can they became common saying following apollo armstrong words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies while most people celebrated the accomplishment disenfranchised americans saw it as symbol of the divide in america evidenced by protesters outside of kennedy space center the day before apollo launched this is not to say they were not awed by it ralph abernathy leading protest march was so captivated by the spectacle of the apollo launch that he forgot what he was going to say racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on earth poem by gil scott heron called whitey on the moon illustrated the racial inequality in the united states that was highlighted by the space race the poem starts with twenty percent of the world population watched humans walk on the moon for the first time while apollo sparked the interest of the world the follow on apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation one possible explanation was the shift in complexity landing someone on the moon was an easy goal to understand lunar geology was too abstract for the average person another is that kennedy goal of landing humans on the moon had already been accomplished well defined objective helped project apollo accomplish its goal but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions while most americans were proud of their nation achievements in space exploration only once during the late did the gallup poll indicate that majority of americans favored doing more in space as opposed to doing less by percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration the space race had ended and cold war tensions were easing as the us and soviet union entered the era of détente this was also time when inflation was rising which put pressure on the government to reduce spending what saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great drastic cuts warned caspar weinberger the deputy director of the office of management and budget might send signal that our best years are behind us after the apollo mission officials from the soviet union said landing humans on the moon was dangerous and unnecessary at the time the soviet union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically the soviets publicly denied there was race to the moon and indicated they were not making an attempt mstislav keldysh said in july we are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems it was revealed in that the soviets had tried to send people to the moon but were unable due to technological difficulties the public reaction in the soviet union was mixed the soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing which affected the reaction portion of the populace did not give it any attention and another portion was angered by it the apollo landing is referenced in the songs armstrong aldrin and collins by the byrds on the album ballad of easy rider and coon on the moon by howlin wolf on the album the back door wolf spacecraft columbia on display in the milestones of flight exhibition hall at the national air and space museum the command module columbia went on tour of the united states visiting state capitals the district of columbia and anchorage alaska in it was transferred to the smithsonian institution and was

center from april to september the senator john heinz history center in pittsburgh from september to february and its last location at museum of flight in seattle from march to september continued renovations at the smithsonian allowed time for an additional stop for the capsule and it was moved to the cincinnati museum center the ribbon cutting ceremony was on september for years armstrong and aldrin space suits were displayed in the museum apollo to the moon exhibit until it permanently closed on december to be replaced by new gallery which was scheduled to open in special display of armstrong suit was unveiled for the th anniversary of apollo in july the quarantine trailer the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the smithsonian steven udvar hazy center annex near washington dulles international airport in chantilly virginia where they are on display along with test lunar module the descent stage of the lm eagle remains on the moon in the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro imaged the various apollo landing sites on the surface of the moon for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules scientific instruments and foot trails made by the astronauts the remains of the ascent stage lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface after being abandoned and impacting the moon the location is uncertain because eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after short time in march team of specialists financed by amazon founder jeff bezos located the engines from the ic stage that launched apollo into space they were found on the atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning his team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface in july conservator discovered serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the atlantic which nasa confirmed was from apollo the ivb third stage which performed apollo trans lunar injection remains in solar orbit near to that of earth pieces of fabric and wood from the first airplane the wright flyer traveled to the moon in the lunar module and are displayed at the wright brothers national memorial moon rocks the main repository for the apollo moon rocks is the lunar sample laboratory facility at the lyndon johnson space center in houston texas for safekeeping there is also smaller collection stored at white sands test facility near las cruces new mexico most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture they are handled only indirectly using special tools over research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples and approximately samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year in november nixon asked nasa to make up about presentation apollo lunar sample displays for nations the fifty states of the united states and its possessions and the united nations each display included moon dust from apollo the rice sized particles were four small pieces of moon soil weighing about mg and were enveloped in clear acrylic button about as big as united states half dollar coin this acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust the apollo lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by nixon in experiment results the passive seismic experiment ran until the command uplink failed on august the downlink failed on december the lunar laser ranging experiment remains operational armstrong camera armstrong hasselblad camera was thought to be lost or left on the moon surface in after armstrong died in his widow contacted the national air and space museum to inform them she had found white cloth bag in one of armstrong closets the bag contained forgotten camera that had been used to capture images of the first moon landing the camera is currently on display at the national air and space museum anniversary events th anniversary

apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and the first to reach the moon orbit it and return its three astronaut crew frank borman james lovell and william anders were the first humans to fly to the moon to witness and photograph an earthrise and to escape the gravity of celestial body apollo launched on december and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the united states apollo space program after apollo which stayed in earth orbit apollo was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the saturn rocket and was the first human spaceflight from the kennedy space center located adjacent to cape canaveral air force station in florida originally planned as the second crewed apollo lunar module and command module test to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early the mission profile was changed in august to more ambitious command module only lunar orbital flight to be flown in december as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight astronaut jim mcdivitt crew who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low earth orbit became the crew for the apollo mission and borman crew were moved to the apollo mission this left borman crew with two to three months less training and preparation time than originally planned and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training apollo took hours almost three days to travel the distance to the moon the crew orbited the moon ten times over the course of twenty hours during which they made christmas eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the book of genesis at the time the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever apollo successful mission paved the way for apollo to fulfill president john kennedy goal of landing man on the moon before the end of the the apollo astronauts returned to earth on december when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean the crew members were named time magazine men of the year for upon their return background in the late and early the united states was engaged in the cold war geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october the soviet union launched sputnik the first artificial satellite this unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world it not only demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over distances it challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority the launch precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president john kennedy believed that not only was it in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations but that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality it was therefore intolerable to him for the soviet union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration he was determined that the united states should compete and sought challenge that maximized its chances of winning the soviet union had better booster rockets which meant kennedy needed to choose goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry one where the us and soviet union would be starting from position of equality something spectacular even if it could not be justified on military economic or scientific grounds after consulting with his experts and advisors he chose such project to land man on the moon and return him to the earth this project already had name project apollo an early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous under which specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface the apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components command module cm with cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that would return to earth service module sm to provide the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and two stage lunar module lm which comprised descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit this configuration could be launched by the saturn rocket that was then under development framework prime crew the initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander michael collins as command module pilot cmp and william anders as lunar module pilot lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november collins was replaced by jim lovell in july after suffering cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair this crew was unique among pre space shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew lovell had flown twice before on gemini vii and gemini xii this would also be the first case of commander of previous mission lovell gemini xii flying as non commander this was also the first mission to reunite crewmates from previous mission lovell and borman gemini vii as of all three apollo astronauts remain alive backup crew the backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander lovell as cmp and buzz aldrin as lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew when lovell was reassigned to the prime crew aldrin was moved to cmp and fred haise was brought in as backup lmp armstrong would later command apollo with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp haise served on the backup crew of apollo as lmp and flew on apollo as lmp support personnel during projects mercury and gemini each mission had prime and backup crew for apollo third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes the support crew developed procedures in the simulators especially those for emergency situations so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training for apollo the support crew consisted of ken mattingly vance brand and gerald carr the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for apollo the capcoms were michael collins gerald carr ken mattingly neil armstrong buzz aldrin vance brand and fred haise the mission control teams rotated in three shifts each led by flight director the directors for apollo were clifford charlesworth green team glynn lunney black team and milton windler maroon team mission insignia and callsign robbins medallion the triangular shape of the insignia refers to the shape of the apollo cm it shows red figure looping around the earth and moon to reflect both the mission number and the circumlunar nature of the mission on the bottom of the are the names of the three astronauts the initial design of the insignia was developed by jim lovell who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of flight from california to houston shortly after learning of apollo re designation as lunar orbital mission the crew wanted to name their spacecraft but nasa did not allow it the crew would have likely chosen columbiad the name of the giant cannon that launches space vehicle in jules verne novel from the earth to the moon the apollo cm was named columbia in part for that reason preparations mission schedule on september nasa adopted seven step plan for apollo missions with the final step being moon landing apollo and apollo were missions tests of the saturnv launch vehicle using an uncrewed block production model of the command and service module csm in earth orbit apollo was mission test of the lm in earth orbit apollo scheduled for october would be mission crewed earth orbit flight of the csm further missions depended on the readiness of the lm it had been decided as early as may that there would be at least four additional missions apollo was planned as the mission test of the lm in low earth orbit in december by james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart while borman crew would fly the mission more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as apollo in early the mission would test the csm and lm in lunar orbit and the mission would be the finale the moon landing the first stage of as being erected in the vehicle assembly building vab on february production of the lm fell behind schedule and when apollo lm arrived at the kennedy space center ksc in june more than hundred significant defects were discovered leading bob gilruth the director of the manned spacecraft center msc and others to conclude that there was no prospect of lm being ready to fly in indeed it was possible that delivery would slip to february or march following the original seven step plan would have meant delaying the and subsequent missions and endangering the program goal of lunar landing before the end of george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed solution in august to keep the program on track despite the lm delay since the next csm designated as csm would be ready three months before lm csm only mission could be flown in december instead of repeating the mission flight of apollo this csm could be sent all the way to the moon with the possibility of entering lunar orbit and returning to earth the new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until apollo the scheduled mission this also meant that the medium earth orbit mission could be dispensed with the net result was that only the mission had to be delayed and the plan for lunar landing in mid could remain on timeline on august low discussed the idea with gilruth flight director chris kraft and the director of flight crew operations donald slayton they then flew to the marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama where they met with ksc director kurt debus apollo program director samuel phillips rocco petrone and wernher von braun kraft considered the proposal feasible from flight control standpoint debus and petrone agreed that the next saturn as could be made ready by december and von braun was confident the pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted apollo had been fixed almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel along with the potential for circumlunar flight providing significant morale boost the only person who needed some convincing was james webb the nasa administrator backed by the full support of his agency webb authorized the mission apollo was officially changed from mission to prime lunar orbit mission with the change in mission for apollo slayton asked mcdivitt if he still wanted to fly it mcdivitt turned it down his crew had spent great deal of time preparing to test the lm and that was what he still wanted to do slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the dand emissions this swap also meant swap of spacecraft requiring borman crew to use csm while mcdivitt crew would use csm since cm could not be made ready by december david scott was not happy about giving up cm the testing of which he had closely supervised for cm although the two were almost identical and anders was less than enthusiastic about being an lmp on flight with no lm instead in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance apollo would carry lm test article boilerplate model of lm added pressure on the apollo program to make its landing goal was provided by the soviet union zond mission which flew some living creatures including russian tortoises in cislunar loop around the moon and returned them to earth on september there was speculation within nasa and the press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on similar circumlunar mission before the end of erection and mating of spacecraft to launch vehicle as in the vab for the apollo mission the apollo crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received visit from charles lindbergh and his wife anne morrow lindbergh the night before the launch they talked about how before his flight lindbergh had used piece of string to measure the distance from new york city to paris on globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight the total he had carried was tenth of the amount that the saturn would burn every second the next day the lindberghs watched the launch of apollo from nearby dune saturn redesign the saturn rocket used by apollo was designated as or the rd model of the saturnv rocket to be used in the apollo saturn as program when it was erected in the vehicle assembly building on december it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed earth orbit test flight carrying boilerplate command and service module apollo had suffered several major problems during its april flight including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage two second stage engine failures and third stage that failed to reignite in orbit without assurances that these problems had been rectified nasa administrators could not justify risking crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved the saturn was ready teams from the msfc went to work on the problems of primary concern was the pogo oscillation which would not only hamper engine performance but could exert significant forces on crew task force of contractors nasa agency representatives and msfc researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated causing resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed pad of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight researchers quickly determined that leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum causing loss of fuel pressure in engine two when an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two it had accidentally shut down engine three liquid oxygen due to miswired connection as result engine three failed within one second of engine two shutdown further investigation revealed the same problem for the third stage engine faulty igniter line the team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches the teams tested their solutions in august at the msfc saturn stage ic was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team solution to the problem of pogo oscillation while saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions once nasa administrators were convinced that the problems had been solved they gave their approval for crewed mission using as the apollo spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september and the rocket made the slow journey to the launch pad on october testing continued all through december until the day before launch including various levels of readiness testing from december through final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation ruptured fuel lines and bad igniter lines took place on december three days before the scheduled launch mission parameter summary mission profile as the first crewed spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body apollo profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by translunar injection maneuver apollo lunar missions would begin with nominal circular earth parking orbit apollo was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of and perigee of with an inclination of to the equator and an orbital period of minutes propellant venting increased the apogee by over the hours minutes and seconds spent in the parking orbit this was followed by trans lunar injection tli burn of the ivb third stage for seconds accelerating the command and service module and lm test article from an orbital velocity of to the injection velocity of which set record for the highest speed relative to earth that humans had ever traveled this speed was slightly less than the earth escape velocity of but put apollo into an elongated elliptical earth orbit close enough to the moon to be captured by the moon gravity the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as nominal circular orbit above the moon surface initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with perilune of and an apolune of at an inclination of from the lunar equator this was then circularized at by with an orbital period of minutes the effect of lunar mass concentrations mascons on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted over the course of the ten lunar orbits lasting twenty hours the orbital distance was perturbated to by apollo achieved maximum distance from earth of launch and trans lunar injection apollo launch apollo was launched at utc eastern standard time on december using the saturn three stages to achieve earth orbit the ic first stage landed in the atlantic ocean at and the ii second stage landed at the ivb third stage injected the craft into earth orbit and remained attached to perform the tli burn that would put the spacecraft on trajectory to the moon once the vehicle reached earth orbit both the crew and houston flight controllers spent the next hours and minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli the proper operation of the ivb third stage of the rocket was crucial and in the last uncrewed test it had failed to reignite for this burn collins was the first capcom on duty and at hours minutes and seconds after launch he radioed apollo you are go for tli this communication meant that mission control had given official permission for apollo to go to the moon the ivb engine ignited on time and performed the tli burn perfectly over the next five minutes the spacecraft speed increased from after the ivb had placed the mission on course for the moon the command and service modules csm the remaining apollo spacecraft separated from it the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it this marked the first time humans had viewed the whole earth at once borman became worried that the ivb was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform separation maneuver mission control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the small reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module sm to add to their velocity away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the ivb after discussion the crew and mission control decided to burn in the earth direction to increase speed but at instead the time needed to prepare and perform the additional burn put the crew an hour behind their onboard tasks apollo ivb rocket stage shortly after separation five hours after launch mission control sent command to the ivb to vent its remaining fuel changing its trajectory the ivb with the test article attached posed no further hazard to apollo passing the orbit of the moon and going into solar orbit with an inclination of from the plane of the ecliptic and an orbital period of days it became derelict object and will continue to orbit the sun for many years the apollo crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts which extend up to from earth scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft high speed would cause radiation dosage of no more than chest ray or milligray mgy during year the average human receives dose of to mgy to record the actual radiation dosages each crew member wore personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the crew members experienced an average radiation dose of mgy lunar trajectory lovell main job as command module pilot was as navigator although mission control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to earth in case communication with mission control was lost lovell navigated by star sightings using sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between star and the earth or the moon horizon this task was made difficult by large cloud of debris around the spacecraft which made it hard to distinguish the stars by seven hours into the mission the crew was about hour and minutes behind flight plan because of the problems in moving away from the ivb and lovell obscured star sightings the crew placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc also called barbecue roll in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft in direct sunlight parts of the spacecraft outer surface could be heated to over while the parts in shadow would be these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack and propellant lines to burst because it was impossible to get perfect roll the spacecraft swept out cone as it rotated the crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger first image taken by humans of the whole earth disk probably photographed by william anders south is up south america is in the middle the first mid course correction came eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for more than hours before launch nasa had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system sps engine had small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first by burning the engine for short period this first correction burn was only seconds and added about velocity prograde in the direction of travel this change was less than the planned because of bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure the crew had to use the small rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned mid course corrections were canceled because the apollo trajectory was found to be perfect about an hour after starting his sleep shift borman obtained permission from ground control to take seconal sleeping pill the pill had little effect borman eventually fell asleep and then awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had bout of diarrhea this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces which the crew cleaned up as well as they could borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control the crew decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed after recording description of borman illness they asked mission control to check the recording stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments the apollo crew and mission control medical personnel held conference using an unoccupied second floor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floors only one of which was used during mission the conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that borman illness was either hour flu as borman thought or reaction to the sleeping pill researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and later astronaut rusty schweickart during apollo still from film of the crew taken while they were in orbit around the moon frank borman is in the center the cruise phase was relatively uneventful part of the flight except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course during this time nasa scheduled television broadcast at hours after launch the apollo crew used camera that broadcast in black and white only using vidicon tube the camera had two lenses very wide angle lens and telephoto lens during this first broadcast the crew gave tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space however difficulties aiming the narrow angle lens without the aid of monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible additionally without proper filters the earth image became saturated by any bright source in the end all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was bright blob after broadcasting for minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the high gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother happy birthday by this time the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts lovell went to sleep and half hours into the flight and half hours before he had planned to short while later anders also went to sleep after taking sleeping pill the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to out gassed oils from the silicone sealant and the attitude required for passive thermal control it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time apollo made second television broadcast at hours into the flight this time the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth what was visible and the colors they could see the transmission lasted minutes lunar sphere of influence this photograph of the moon was taken from apollo at point above degrees east longitude at about hours and minutes into the flight and hours before entering lunar orbit the crew of apollo became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body in other words the effect of the moon gravitational force on apollo became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened apollo was from the moon and had speed of relative to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center they would continue to do so until they performed their last mid course correction switching to reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit the last major event before lunar orbit insertion loi was second mid course correction it was in retrograde against the direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by effectively reducing the closest distance at which the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly hours after launch about from the moon the crew burned the rcs for seconds they would now pass from the lunar surface at hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion loi this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for go no go decision the crew was told at hours that they were go and riding the best bird we can find lovell replied we ll see you on the other side and for the first time in history humans travelled behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth with ten minutes remaining before loi the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in its correct position at that time they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface the loi burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view lunar orbit the sps was ignited at hours minutes and seconds after launch and burned for minutes and seconds placing the apollo spacecraft in orbit around the moon the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in highly elliptical lunar orbit or even been flung off into space if it had lasted too long they could have struck the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next hours on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would have appeared early from behind the moon exactly at the calculated moment however the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in orbit around the moon after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like lunar far side as seen from apollo lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over one of the crew major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that was planned as the apollo landing site the launch time of apollo had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the moon below bill anders spent much of the next hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew had taken over eight hundred mm still photographs and of mm movie film throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive go no go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up equipment to broadcast view of the lunar surface anders described the craters that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed an second loi burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to throughout the next two orbits the crew continued to check the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon during the third pass borman read small prayer for his church he had been scheduled to participate in service at st christopher episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollo flight he was unable to attend fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service earthrise when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front the crew witnessed an earthrise in person for the first time in human history nasa lunar orbiter had taken the first picture of an earthrise from the vicinity of the moon on august anders saw the earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others taking black and white photograph as he did so anders asked lovell for color film and then took earthrise now famous color photo later picked by life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century due to the synchronous rotation of the moon about the earth earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface this is because as seen from any one place on the moon surface earth remains in approximately the same position in the lunar sky either above or below the horizon earthrise is generally visible only while orbiting the moon and at selected surface locations near the moon limb where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon apollo genesis reading anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so that borman could rest despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status borman awoke fully however when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having good night sleep in over three days he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed anders initially protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed anders finally agreed under the condition that borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the moon borman also remembered that there was second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the astronauts began the second television transmission borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had message for all those on earth each man on board read section from the biblical creation story from the book of genesis borman finished the broadcast by wishing merry christmas to everyone on earth his message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit borman said and from the crew of apollo we close with good night good luck merry christmas and god bless all of you all of you on the good earth the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the trans earth injection tei which was scheduled for hours after the end of the television transmission the tei was the most critical burn of the flight as any failure of the sps to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape as with the previous burn the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the moon out of contact with earth the burn occurred exactly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re emerged from behind the moon at hours minutes and seconds the exact time calculated when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is santa claus to which ken mattingly the current capcom replied that affirmative you are the best ones to know the spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december christmas day unplanned manual realignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard however he accidentally erased some of the computer memory which caused the inertial measurement unit imu to contain data indicating that the module was in the same relative orientation it had been in before lift off the imu then fired the thrusters to correct the module attitude once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module attitude they realized that they would have to reenter data to tell the computer the module actual orientation it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later during the apollo mission lovell would have to perform similar manual realignment under more critical conditions after the module imu had to be turned off to conserve energy cruise back to earth and reentry reentry december photographed from alt white streaks of light with bright spots on the right side of them fill the bottom of the frame larger yellow tinted sphere with streak is in the center of the frame the background is black space the cruise back to earth was mostly time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would reenter earth atmosphere two and half days after tei and splash down in the pacific on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth television broadcast this time they gave tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they finished broadcasting they found small present from slayton in the food locker real turkey dinner with stuffing in the same kind of pack given to the troops in vietnam another slayton surprise was gift of three miniature bottles of brandy which borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed they remained unopened even years after the flight there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the next day at about hours into the mission the sixth and final tv transmission showed the mission best video images of the earth during four minute broadcast after two uneventful days the crew prepared for reentry the computer would control the reentry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude with the blunt end forward in the event of computer failure borman was ready to take over separation from the service module prepared the command module for reentry by exposing the heat shield and shedding unneeded mass the service module would burn up in the atmosphere as planned six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earth horizon just as had been calculated by the trajectory specialists as the module hit the thin outer atmosphere the crew noticed that it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft the spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft apollo rose briefly like skipping stone before descending to the ocean at the drogue parachute deployed stabilizing the spacecraft followed at by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in the north pacific ocean southwest of hawaii at utc on december crew of apollo addressing the crew of uss yorktown after successful splashdown and recovery command module on the deck of when the spacecraft hit the water the parachutes dragged it over and left it upside down in what was termed stable position as they were buffeted by swell borman was sick waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft about six minutes after splashdown the command module was righted into normal apex up orientation by its inflatable bag uprighting system the first frogman from aircraft carrier arrived minutes after splashdown forty five minutes later the crew was safe on the flight deck of the yorktown legacy historical importance apollo came at the end of year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world even though the year saw political assassinations political unrest in the streets of europe and america and the prague spring time magazine chose the crew of apollo as its men of the year for recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived mission that even the crew themselves had rated as having only fifty fifty chance of fully succeeding the effect of apollo was summed up in telegram from stranger received by borman after the mission that stated simply thank you apollo you saved one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that the crew took as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon this was the first time that humans had taken such picture while actually behind the camera and it has been credited as one of the inspirations of the first earth day in it was selected as the first of life magazine photographs that changed the world apollo astronauts return to houston after their mission apollo astronaut michael collins said eight momentous historic significance was foremost while space historian robert poole saw apollo as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercury atlas by john glenn in there were journalists covering the mission with the bbc coverage broadcast in countries in different languages the soviet newspaper pravda featured quote from boris nikolaevich petrov chairman of the soviet interkosmos program who described the flight as an outstanding achievement of american space sciences and technology it is estimated that quarter of the people alive at the time saw either live or delayed the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon the apollo broadcasts won an emmy award the highest honor given by the academy of television arts sciences madalyn murray hair an atheist later caused controversy by bringing lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis hair wanted the courts to ban american astronauts who were all government employees from public prayer in space though the case was rejected by the supreme court of the united states apparently for lack of jurisdiction in outer space it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on apollo self communicated presbyterian communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and referred to it only obliquely at the time apollo commemorative stamp in the united states post office department issued postage stamp scott catalogue commemorating the apollo flight around the moon the stamp featured detail of the famous photograph of the earthrise over the moon taken by anders on christmas eve and the words in the beginning god the first words of the book of genesis in january just days after the crew return to earth they appeared in the super bowl iii pre game show reciting the pledge of allegiance before the national anthem was performed by anita bryant spacecraft location in january the spacecraft was delivered to osaka japan for display in the pavilion at expo it is now displayed at the chicago museum

nasa astronaut bruce mccandless ii using manned maneuvering unit outside on shuttle mission sts in an astronaut is person trained by human spaceflight program to command pilot or serve as crew member of spacecraft members of the space program of russia or the soviet union are referred to as cosmonauts although generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists the root naut derives from nautes greek for sailor until astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut definition alan shepard aboard freedom the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary with some focus on the point where the atmosphere becomes so thin that centrifugal force rather than aerodynamic force carries significant portion of the weight of the flight object the fédération aéronautique internationale fai sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed the kármán line at an altitude of in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of are awarded astronaut wings total of people from countries have reached or more in altitude of whom reached low earth orbit or beyond of these people have traveled beyond low earth orbit either to lunar orbit the lunar surface or in one case loop around the moon three of the jim lovell john young and eugene cernan did so twice under the definition people qualify as having reached space above altitude of eight pilots who exceeded in altitude only one exceeded kilometers about miles space travelers have spent over man days man years in space including over astronaut days of spacewalks the man with the longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka who has spent days in space peggy whitson holds the record for the most time in space by woman days terminology in when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos near space while the astro prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut which survived by common usage as the preferred american term when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in they chose term which anglicizes to cosmonaut english white mcdivitt young see conrad borman armstrong stafford lovell front row cooper grissom carpenter schirra glenn shepard slayton in english speaking nations professional space traveler is called an astronaut the term derives from the greek words ástron ἄστρον meaning star and nautes ναύτης meaning sailor the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil jones in his short story the death head meteor the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy greg book across the zodiac astronaut referred to spacecraft in les navigateurs de infini by rosny aîné the word astronautique astronautic was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in to balloonists an early use of astronaut in non fiction publication is eric frank russell poem the astronaut appearing in the november bulletin of the british interplanetary society the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as title for those selected to join its astronaut corps the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps russian leonov titov bykovsky yegorov popovich front row komarov gagarin tereshkova nikolayev feoktistov belyayev by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its soviet predecessor is called cosmonaut in english texts the word is an anglicization of kosmonavt one who works in space outside the earth atmosphere space traveler which derives from the ancient greek words kósmos meaning universe and naútēs meaning sailor other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word such as the although polish also uses and the two words are considered synonyms coinage of the term has been credited to soviet aeronautics or cosmonautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space he was part of the first six russians with german titov yevgeny khrunov andriyan nikolayev pavel popovich and grigoriy nelyubov who were given the title of pilot cosmonaut in january valentina tereshkova was the first female cosmonaut and the first and youngest woman to have flown in space with solo mission on the vostok in on march norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut chinese space universe navigating personnel is used for astronauts and cosmonauts in general while navigating outer space personnel is used for chinese astronauts here is strictly defined as the navigation of outer space within the local star system solar system the phrase spaceman is often used in hong kong and taiwan the term taikonaut is used by some english language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as hybrid of the chinese term space and the sailor the term became more common in when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou spacecraft this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese people daily since the advent of the chinese space program the origin of the term is unclear as early as may chiew lee yih from malaysia used it in newsgroups other terms with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies finnish american astronaut timothy kopra while no nation other than russia and previously the soviet union the united states and china have launched crewed spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries the soviet led interkosmos programme inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word for space the malay term deriving from angkasa meaning space was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space research organisation hope to launch spacecraft in that would carry vyomanauts coined from the sanskrit word meaning sky or space in finland the nasa astronaut timothy kopra finnish american has sometimes been referred to as from the finnish word as of in the united states astronaut status is conferred on person depending on the authorizing agency one who flies in vehicle above for nasa or the military is considered an astronaut with no qualifier one who flies in vehicle to the international space station in mission coordinated by nasa and roscosmos is spaceflight participant one who flies above in non nasa vehicle as crewmember is considered commercial astronaut by the federal aviation administration one who flies to the international space station as part of privately funded dedicated commercial spaceflight on commercial launch vehicle dedicated to the mission to conduct approved commercial and marketing activities on the space station or in commercial segment attached to the station is considered private astronaut by nasa as of nobody has yet qualified for this status generally accepted but unofficial term for paying non crew passenger who flies private non nasa or military vehicles above is space tourist as of nobody has yet qualified for this status space travel milestones yuri gagarin first human in space valentina tereshkova first woman in space neil armstrong first human to walk on the

see during water egress training with nasa the first nasa astronauts were selected for training in early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter of the mercury seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots the earliest astronauts for both the us and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in facility such as nasa neutral buoyancy laboratory astronauts in training astronaut candidates may also experience short periods of weightlessness microgravity in an aircraft called the vomit comet the nickname given to pair of modified kc retired in and respectively and replaced in with which perform parabolic flights astronauts are also required to accumulate number of flight hours in high performance jet aircraft this is mostly done in jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from edwards air force base astronauts in training must learn how to control and fly the space shuttle and it is vital that they are familiar with the international space station so they know what they must do when they get there nasa candidacy requirements the candidate must be citizen of the united states the candidate must complete master degree in stem field including engineering biological science physical science computer science or mathematics the candidate must have at least two years of related professional experience obtained after degree completion or at least hours pilot in command time on jet aircraft the candidate must be able to pass the nasa long duration flight astronaut physical the candidate must also have skills in leadership teamwork and communications the master degree

completion of nationally recognized test pilot school program mission specialist educator applicants must have bachelor degree with teaching experience including work at the kindergarten through twelfth grade level an advanced degree such as master degree or doctoral degree is not required but is strongly desired mission specialist educators or educator astronauts were first selected in and as of there are three nasa educator astronauts joseph acaba richard arnold and dorothy metcalf lindenburger barbara morgan selected as back up teacher to christa mcauliffe in is considered to be the first educator astronaut by the media but she trained as mission specialist the educator astronaut program is successor to the teacher in space program from the health risks of space travel gennady padalka performing ultrasound on michael fincke during iss expedition astronauts are susceptible to variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance sleep disturbances and radiation injury variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space biomedical research institute nsbri to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this study techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non expert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to trained physician is often rare space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space more recently in bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the near weightlessness of space microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space on december nasa supported study reported that human spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimer disease in october the nasa office of inspector general issued health hazards report related to space exploration including human mission to mars over the last decade flight surgeons and scientists at nasa have seen pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long duration space missions the syndrome known as visual impairment intracranial pressure viip has been reported in nearly two thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the international space station iss on november scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken trips in space based on mri studies astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body it can affect the otolith organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system zero gravity and cosmic rays can cause many implications for astronauts in october nasa funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space including travel to the planet mars may substantially damage the tissues of astronauts the studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the brains of astronauts and age them prematurely researchers in reported after detecting the presence on the international space station iss of five enterobacter bugandensis bacterial strains none pathogenic to humans that microorganisms on iss should be carefully monitored to continue assuring medically healthy environment for astronauts study by russian scientists published in april stated that astronauts facing space radiation could face temporary hindrance of their memory centres while this does not affect their intellectual capabilities it temporarily hinders formation of new cells in brain memory centers the study conducted by moscow institute of physics and technology mipt concluded this after they observed that mice exposed to neutron and gamma radiation did not impact the rodents intellectual capabilities study conducted on the brains of eight male russian cosmonauts after they returned from long stays aboard the international space station showed that long duration spaceflight causes many physiological adaptions including macro and microstructural changes while scientists still know little about the effects of spaceflight on brain structure this study showed that space travel can lead to new motor skills dexterity but also slightly weaker vision both of which could possibly be long lasting it was the first study to provide clear evidence of sensorimotor neuroplasticity which is the brain ability to change through growth and reorganization food and drink astronauts making and eating hamburgers on board the iss august an astronaut on the international

modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being burthen to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as modest proposal is juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in the essay suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food to rich gentlemen and ladies this satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor as well as british policy toward the irish in general in english writing the phrase modest proposal is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight faced satire synopsis swift essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swift solution when he states young healthy child well nursed is at year old most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and make no doubt that it will equally serve in fricassee or ragout swift goes to great lengths to support his argument including list of possible preparation styles for the children and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then influential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon these lampoons include appealing to the authority of very knowing american of my acquaintance in london and the famous psalmanazar native of the island formosa who had already confessed to not being from formosa in in the tradition of roman satire swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis population solutions george wittkowsky argued that swift main target in modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland but rather the can do spirit of the times that led people to devise number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with simple cure all solution memorable example of these sorts of schemes involved the idea of running the poor through joint stock company in response swift modest proposal was burlesque of projects concerning the poor that were in vogue during the early th century modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects the pamphlet targets reformers who regard people as commodities in the piece swift adopts the technique of political arithmetician to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics critics differ about swift intentions in using this faux mathematical philosophy edmund wilson argues that statistically the logic of the modest proposal can be compared with defence of crime arrogated to marx in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population wittkowsky counters that swift satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that springs from spirit of bitter mockery not from the delight in calculations for their own sake rhetoric charles smith argues that swift rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish swift specific strategy is twofold using trap to create sympathy for the irish and dislike of the narrator who in the span of one sentence details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty but feels emotion solely for members of his own class swift use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator cool approach towards them create two opposing points of view that alienate the reader perhaps unconsciously from narrator who can view with melancholy detachment subject that swift has directed us rhetorically to see in much less detached way swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals lewis argues that the speaker uses the vocabulary of animal husbandry to describe the irish once the children have been commodified swift rhetoric can easily turn people into animals then meat and from meat logically into tonnage worth price per pound swift uses the proposer serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal in making his argument the speaker uses the conventional textbook approved order of argument from swift time which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian the contrast between the careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme and the ridiculousness of the proposal create situation in which the reader has to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such diligent thoughtful and conventional man to propose so perverse plan influences scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote modest proposal tertullian apology james william johnson argues that modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullian apology satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations johnson notes swift obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works modest proposal and apology in structure johnson points out the same central theme that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument that human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human stylistically swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language in agreement with johnson donald baker points out the similarity between both authors tones and use of irony baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic justification by ownership over the subject of sacrificing children tertullian while attacking pagan parents and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poor defoe the generous projector it has also been argued that modest proposal was at least in part response to the essay the generous projector or friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swift rival daniel defoe mandeville modest defence of publick stews bernard mandeville modest defence of publick stews asked to introduce public and state controlled bordellos the paper acknowledges women interests andwhile not being completely satirical texthas also been discussed as an inspiration for jonathan swift title mandeville had by already become famous for the fable of the bees and deliberations on private vices and public benefits john locke first treatise of government john locke commented be it then as sir robert says that anciently it was usual for men to sell and castrate their children let it be that they exposed them add to it if you please for this is still greater power that they begat them for their tables to fat and eat them if this proves right to do so we may by the same argument justifie adultery incest and sodomy for there are examples of these too both ancient and modern sins which suppose have the principle aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriage bed as necessary thereunto first treatise sec economic themes robert phiddian article have you eaten yet the reader in modest proposal focuses on two aspects of modest proposal the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer phiddian stresses that reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer he reminds readers that there is gap between the narrator meaning and the text and that moral political argument is being carried out by means of parody while swift proposal is obviously not serious economic proposal george wittkowsky author of swift modest proposal the biography of an early georgian pamphlet argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swift time wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in th century england if one regards the modest proposal simply as criticism of condition about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swift irony brilliantly underscored this fact people are the riches of nation at the start of new industrial age in the th century it was believed that people are the riches of the nation and there was general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less furthermore in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry in those times the somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as commodity louis landa composed conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to become source of wealth to the nation or else they must turn to begging and thievery this opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for diversifying their professions or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in ireland landa wrote that swift is maintaining that the maxim people are the riches of nation applies to ireland only if ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism landa presents swift modest proposal as critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the th century that people are the riches of nation swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself in ireland case did not always mean greater wealth and economy the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes country poorer not richer swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy paradox the wealth of country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens swift however landa argues is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as mere commodity the public reaction swift essay created backlash within the community after its publication the work was aimed at the aristocracy and they responded in turn several members of society wrote to swift regarding the work lord bathurst letter intimated that he certainly understood the message and interpreted it as work of comedy february did immediately propose it to lady bathurst as your advice particularly for her last boy which was born the plumpest finest thing that could be seen but she fell in passion and bid me send you word that she would not follow your direction but that she would breed him up to be parson and he should live upon the fat of the land or lawyer and then instead of being eat himself he should devour others you know women in passion never mind what they say but as she is very reasonable woman have almost brought her over now to your opinion and having convinced her that as matters stood we could not possibly maintain all the nine she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest and upon that foot man may perform family duty with more courage and zeal for if he should happen to get twins the selling of one might provide for the other or if by any accident while his wife lies in with one child he should get second upon the body of another woman he might dispose of the fattest of the two and that would help to breed up the other the more think upon this scheme the more reasonable it appears to me and it ought by no means to be confined to ireland for in all probability we shall in very little time be altogether as poor here as you are there believe indeed we shall carry it farther and not confine our luxury only to the eating of children for happened to peep the other day into large assembly parliament not far from westminster hall and found them roasting great fat fellow walpole again for my own part had not the least inclination to slice of him but if guessed right four or five of the company had devilish mind to be at him well adieu you begin now to wish had ended when might have done it so conveniently modern usage modest proposal is included in many literature courses as an example of early modern western satire it also serves as an introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language lending itself to secondary and post secondary essay courses outside of the realm of english studies modest proposal is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts humanities and even the social sciences the essay approach has been copied many times in his book modest proposal the evangelical author frank schaeffer emulated swift work in social conservative polemic against abortion and euthanasia imagining future dystopia that advocates recycling of aborted embryos fetuses and some disabled infants with compound intellectual physical and physiological difficulties such baby doe rules cases were then major concern of the us anti abortion movement of the early which viewed selective treatment of those infants as disability discrimination in his book modest proposal for america statistician howard friedman opens with

the alkali metals consist of the chemical elements lithium li sodium na potassium rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr together with hydrogen they constitute group which lies in the block of the periodic table all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an orbital this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties indeed the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting well characterised homologous behaviour this family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element the alkali metals are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge they can all be cut easily with knife due to their softness exposing shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen and in the case of lithium nitrogen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements caesium the fifth alkali metal is the most reactive of all the metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity francium occurs only in minute traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium uue which is likely to be the next member of the group none was successful however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues most alkali metals have many different applications one of the best known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the second common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium vapour lamp which emits light very efficiently table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity lithium finds use as psychiatric medication and as an anode in lithium batteries sodium and potassium are also essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful history petalite the lithium mineral from which lithium was first isolated sodium compounds have been known since ancient times salt sodium chloride has been an important commodity in human activities as testified by the english word salary referring to salarium money paid to roman soldiers for the purchase of salt while potash has been used since ancient times it was not understood for most of its history to be fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in and henri louis duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus antoine lavoisier did not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in pure potassium was first isolated in in england by humphry davy who derived it from caustic potash koh potassium hydroxide by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium extreme reactivity potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis later that same year davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda naoh lye by similar technique demonstrating the elements and thus the salts to be different johann wolfgang döbereiner was among the first to notice similarities between what are now known as the alkali metals petalite li al si was discovered in by the brazilian chemist josé bonifácio de andrada in mine on the island of utö sweden however it was not until that johan august arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist jöns jacob berzelius detected the presence of new element while analysing petalite ore this new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithion lithina from the greek word λιθoς transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood he named the metal inside the material lithium lithium sodium and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity as they are among series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by johann wolfgang döbereiner in as having similar properties lepidolite the rubidium mineral from which rubidium was first isolated rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope invented in by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff the next year they discovered caesium in the mineral water from bad dürkheim germany their discovery of rubidium came the following year in heidelberg germany finding it in the mineral lepidolite the names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra bright red line for rubidium from the latin word rubidus meaning dark red or bright red and sky blue line for caesium derived from the latin word caesius meaning sky blue around john newlands produced series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions his version put all the alkali metals then known lithium to caesium as well as copper silver and thallium which show the oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals together into group his table placed hydrogen with the halogens dmitri mendeleev periodic system proposed in showing hydrogen and the alkali metals as part of his group along with copper silver and gold after dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of group with sodium potassium rubidium caesium and thallium two years later mendeleev revised his table placing hydrogen in group above lithium and also moving thallium to the boron group in this version copper silver and gold were placed twice once as part of group ib and once as part of group viii encompassing today groups to after the introduction of the column table the group ib elements were moved to their current position in the block while alkali metals were left in group ia later the group name was changed to group in the trivial name alkali metals comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water there were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before marguerite perey of the curie institute in paris france discovered francium in by purifying sample of actinium which had been reported to have decay energy of kev however perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below kev perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by previously unidentified decay product one that was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure actinium various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element caused by the alpha decay of actinium perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium her first test put the alpha branching at figure that she later revised to the next element below francium eka francium in the periodic table would be ununennium uue element the synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in by bombarding target of einsteinium with calcium ions at the superhilac accelerator at berkeley california no atoms were identified leading to limiting yield of nb no atoms it is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass relatively long half life of days and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms to make large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of superheavy elements however given that ununennium is only the first period element on the extended periodic table it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions and indeed an attempt to synthesise it is currently ongoing in japan currently none of the period elements has been discovered yet and it is also possible due to drip instabilities that only the lower period elements up to around element are physically possible no attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals due to their extremely high atomic number they would require new more powerful methods and technology to make occurrence in the solar system estimated abundances of the chemical elements in the solar system hydrogen and helium are most common from the big bang the next three elements lithium beryllium and boron are rare because they are poorly synthesised in the big bang and also in stars the two general trends in the remaining stellar produced elements are an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers and general decrease in abundance as elements become heavier iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae the oddo harkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers with the exception of hydrogen this rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another thus increasing their atomic number in elements with even atomic numbers protons are paired with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other enhancing stability all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals in the solar system the heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both big bang nucleosynthesis and in stars the big bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium beryllium and boron due to the absence of stable nucleus with or nucleons and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple alpha process fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon and skipping over those three elements on earth spodumene an important lithium mineral the earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the sun but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system in turn the natural history of the earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements the mass of the earth is approximately kg it is composed mostly of iron oxygen silicon magnesium sulfur nickel calcium and aluminium with the remaining consisting of trace amounts of other elements due to planetary differentiation the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron with smaller amounts of nickel sulfur and less than trace elements the alkali metals due to their high reactivity do not occur naturally in pure form in nature they are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the earth surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica forming relatively low density minerals that do not sink down into the earth core potassium rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth both being among the ten most common elements in earth crust sodium makes up approximately of the earth crust measured by weight making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal potassium makes up approximately of the earth crust and is the seventh most abundant element sodium is found in many different minerals of which the most common is ordinary salt sodium chloride which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater other solid deposits include halite amphibole cryolite nitratine and zeolite many of these solid deposits occur as result of ancient seas evaporating which still occurs now in places such as utah great salt lake and the dead sea despite their near equal abundance in earth crust sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean both because potassium larger size makes its salts less soluble and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium despite its chemical similarity lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size due to its relatively low reactivity it can be found in seawater in large amounts it is estimated that seawater is approximately to parts per million ppm or micromolar its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals where its crustal concentration is about ppm comparable to that of gallium and niobium commercially the most important lithium mineral is spodumene which occurs in large deposits worldwide rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite carnallite zinnwaldite and lepidolite although none of these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements such as antimony cadmium tin and tungsten but is much less abundant than rubidium francium the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is the product of the alpha decay of actinium and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals in given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every uranium atoms it has been calculated that there are at most grams of francium in the earth crust at any time due to its extremely short half life of minutes properties physical and chemical the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns valence electron configuration which results in weak metallic bonding hence all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities melting and boiling points as well as heats of sublimation vaporisation and dissociation they all crystallise in the body centered cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame colours because their outer electron is very easily excited the ns configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost orbital to form the oxidation state due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group the chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity thus the presentation of its properties here is limited what little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium as expected the physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations properties of the alkali metals name lithium sodium potassium rubidium

to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other indeed the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium rubidium and caesium due to their similar ionic radii lithium and sodium are more distinct for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation in general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium one of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display very smooth trend is their reduction potentials lithium value is anomalous being more negative than the others this is because the li ion has very high hydration energy in the gas phase though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly causing higher change in entropy this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase the stable alkali metals are all silver coloured metals except for caesium which has pale golden tint it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured the other two being copper and gold additionally the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium strontium and barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium are pale yellow though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation they all crystallise in the body centered cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame colours because their outer electron is very easily excited indeed these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble potassium reacts violently with water at room temperature caesium reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature because of this they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene paraffin oil they react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride li the alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care the heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones for example when dropped into water caesium produces larger explosion than potassium if the same number of moles of each metal is used the alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain noble gas configuration by losing just one electron not only do the alkali metals react with water but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols gaseous ammonia and alkynes the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides the second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in full shell that is also closer to the nucleus thus they almost always lose single electron forming cations the alkalides are an exception they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in oxidation state which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations the alkalide anions have filled subshells which gives them enough stability to exist all the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions particularly striking example of an alkalide is inverse sodium hydride na both ions being complexed as opposed to the usual sodium hydride na it is unstable in isolation due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions form aqua ions of the formula where is the solvation number their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii in aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere also known as the first or primary solvation shell the bond between water molecule and the metal ion is dative covalent bond with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules the latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere however for the alkali metal cations the second coordination sphere is not well defined as the charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere producing more stable entity the solvation number for li has been experimentally determined to be forming the tetrahedral li while solvation numbers of to have been found for lithium aqua ions solvation numbers less than may be the result of the formation of contact ion pairs and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach li through face of the tetrahedron though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion there are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion forming the octahedral na ion while it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the and rb ions which have the square antiprismatic structure and that caesium forms the coordinate cs ion lithium the chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds more covalent character lithium and magnesium have diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii so that they show some similarities for example lithium forms stable nitride property common among all the alkaline earth metals magnesium group but unique among the alkali metals in addition among their respective groups only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character lime and mgme lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent conversely lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals probably because li has high solvation energy this effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and air conditioners francium francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high atomic weight causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent in contrast to the trend of decreasing and ionisation energies of the alkali metals francium and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium due to the relativistic stabilisation of the electrons also its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low thus contrary to expectation caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals not francium all known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium such as the first ionisation energy electron affinity and anion polarisability though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity kj mol and the enthalpy of dissociation of the fr molecule kj mol the csfr molecule is polarised as cs fr showing that the subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the subshell of caesium additionally francium superoxide fro is expected to have significant covalent character unlike the other alkali metal superoxides because of bonding contributions from the electrons of francium nuclear primordial isotopes of the alkali metals alkali metal stable decays unstable italics odd odd isotopes coloured pink lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium francium no primordial isotopes is radiogenic nuclide radioactive all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers hence their isotopes must be either odd odd both proton and neutron number are odd or odd even proton number is odd but neutron number is even odd odd nuclei have even mass numbers whereas odd even nuclei have odd mass numbers odd odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are even even and are therefore more strongly bound due to nuclear pairing effects due to the great rarity of odd odd nuclei almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd even the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium and the long lived radioisotope potassium for given odd mass number there can be only single beta stable nuclide since there is not difference in binding energy between even odd and odd even comparable to that between even even and odd odd leaving other nuclides of the same mass number isobars free to beta decay toward the lowest mass nuclide an effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd numbered elements such as the alkali metals tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even numbered elements of the monoisotopic elements that have only single stable isotope all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons beryllium is the single exception to both rules due to its low atomic number all of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope sodium and sodium are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically potassium and rubidium have very long half lives and thus occur naturally and all isotopes of francium are radioactive caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early th century although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes francium had not been discovered yet at that time the natural long lived radioisotope of potassium potassium makes up about of natural potassium and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive this natural radioactivity became basis for mistaken claim of the discovery for element the next alkali metal after caesium in natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive with being the long lived radioisotope rubidium caesium with half life of years is one of the two principal medium lived fission products along with strontium which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling up to several hundred years after use it constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident caesium undergoes high energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium it is strong emitter of gamma radiation caesium has very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way but must be allowed to decay caesium has been used as tracer in hydrologic studies analogous to the use of tritium small amounts of caesium and caesium were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents most notably the goiânia accident and the chernobyl disaster as of caesium is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the chernobyl nuclear power plant its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short to medium lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts and is taken up by the body which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium periodic trends the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation in general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium atomic and ionic radii effective nuclear charge on an atomic electron the atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group because of the shielding effect when an atom has more than one electron shell each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus in the alkali metals the outermost electron only feels net charge of as some of the nuclear charge which is equal to the atomic number is cancelled by the inner electrons the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge therefore the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells since this number increases down the group the atomic radius must also increase down the group the ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii this is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in different electron shell than the inner electrons and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller additionally the effective nuclear charge has increased and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases first ionisation energy periodic trend for ionisation energy each period begins at minimum for the alkali metals and ends at maximum for the noble gases the first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus which is always an outer electron in main group elements the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus since this distance increases down the group the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases this trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of the orbital bringing francium valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non relativistic calculations this makes francium outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium the second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second most loosely held electron is part of fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove reactivity the reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group this is the result of combination of two factors the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions thus increasing reactivity down the group the atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives quantity closely related to but not equal to the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance this quantity decreases going down the group and so does the activation energy thus chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group main groups of the periodic table from the second to the sixth period is chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or functional group to attract electrons or electron density towards itself if the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is in chlorine but is only in sodium the electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom an ionic bond however if the sodium atom was replaced by lithium atom the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium hence the larger alkali metal atoms further down the group will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them as mentioned previously francium is expected to be an exception because of the higher of lithium some of its compounds have more covalent character for example lithium iodide li will dissolve in organic solvents property of most covalent compounds lithium fluoride lif is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water and lithium hydroxide lioh is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent melting and boiling points the melting point of substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of substance in liquid state is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas as metal is heated to its melting point the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal boiling point therefore the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group this is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons as the atoms increase in size going down the group because their atomic radius increases the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil thus lowering the melting and boiling points the increased nuclear charge is not relevant factor due to the shielding effect density the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure body centred cubic and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms since density is defined as mass per unit volume the first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius which increases going down the group thus the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group the mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group thus the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii if figures for these two factors are known the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated the resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table with an exception at potassium due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table lithium sodium and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water in fact lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature compounds the alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions which well illustrate group trends these compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions this description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable for instance ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series nacl na na na na as na sb na bi na hydroxides pounds kg of sodium with water all the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water producing an aqueous solution of strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group lithium reacts steadily with effervescence but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers when an alkali metal is dropped into water it produces an explosion of which there are two separate stages the metal reacts with the water first breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals second the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water lake or other body of water not the initial reaction of the metal with water which tends to happen mostly under water the alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself all alkali metals melt as part of the reaction with water water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal leaving positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions the attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area causing an exponential increase of ionisation when the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension it vigorously explodes the hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides they easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides and may be used to separate thiols from petroleum they react with amphoteric oxides for example the oxides of aluminium zinc tin and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates zincates stannates and plumbates silicon dioxide is acidic and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass intermetallic compounds liquid nak alloy at room temperature the alkali metals form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups to in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries such as the sodium amalgams with mercury including na hg and na hg some of these have ionic characteristics taking the alloys with gold the most electronegative of metals as an example naau and kau are metallic but rbau and csau are semiconductors nak is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air the eutectic mixture melts at an alloy of caesium sodium and potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy compounds with the group elements the intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group elements aluminium gallium indium and thallium such as natl are poor conductors or semiconductors unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the zintl anions involved nevertheless while the elements in group and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters group elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice for example natl consists of polymeric anion tl with covalent diamond cubic structure with na ions located between the anionic lattice the larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group elements to form anionic clusters boron is special case being the only nonmetal in group the alkali metal borides tend to be boron rich involving appreciable boron boron bonding involving deltahedral structures and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having very high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures this makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess furthermore exceptionally in this group reactivity with boron decreases down the group lithium reacts completely at but sodium at and potassium not until and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised various phases are known such as lib nab nab and kb under high pressure the boron boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following wade rules to forming zintl anions like the rest of group compounds with the group elements lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides li and na which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene potassium rubidium and caesium react with graphite their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae mc dark grey almost black mc dark grey almost black mc blue mc steel blue and mc bronze rb or cs these compounds are over times more electrically conductive than pure graphite suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers upon heating of kc the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to kc kc kc and finally kc kc is very strong reducing agent and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water while the larger alkali metals rb and cs initially form mc the smaller ones initially form mc and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around to form apart from this the alkali metals are such strong reducing agents that they can even reduce to produce solid fullerides sodium potassium rubidium and caesium can form fullerides where or and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve when the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group silicon germanium tin and lead ionic substances with cage like structures are formed such as the silicides si rb or cs which contains and tetrahedral ions the chemistry of alkali metal germanides involving the germanide ion ge and other cluster zintl ions such as and ge is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides alkali metal stannides are mostly ionic sometimes with the stannide ion sn and sometimes with more complex zintl ions such as which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide sn the monatomic plumbide ion pb is unknown and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically unfavourable alkali metal plumbides have complex zintl ions such as these alkali metal germanides stannides and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium tin and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia nitrides and pnictides unit cell ball and stick model of lithium nitride on the basis of size tetrahedral structure would be expected but that would be geometrically impossible thus lithium nitride takes on this unique crystal structure lithium the lightest of the alkali metals is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule requires lot of energy the formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal forming ions the energy required to break the triple bond in and the formation of ions and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride the lattice energy is maximised with small highly charged ions the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions only forming ions with charge of so only lithium the smallest alkali metal can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic forming lithium nitride the reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions sodium nitride na and potassium nitride while existing are extremely unstable being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions steric hindrance forbids the existence of rubidium or caesium nitride however sodium and potassium form colourless azide salts involving the linear anion due to the large size of the alkali metal cations they are thermally stable enough to be able to melt before decomposing all the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula pn where represents an alkali metal and pn represents pnictogen phosphorus arsenic antimony or bismuth this is due to the greater size of the and as ions so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form these are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals for example potassium has nine different known phosphides with formulae kp kp and kp while most metals form arsenides only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides the structure of na as is complex with unusually short na na distances of pm which are shorter than in sodium metal and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be ionic other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula as are known such as lias which has metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding the antimonides are unstable and reactive as the sb ion is strong reducing agent reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine sbh indeed they have some metallic properties and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry msb involve antimony atoms bonded in spiral zintl structure bismuthides are not even wholly ionic they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds oxides and chalcogenides all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions they form various types of oxides such as simple oxides containing the ion peroxides containing the ion where there is single bond between the two oxygen atoms superoxides containing the ion and many others lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide but sodium reacts with oxygen to form mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide potassium forms mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively their reactivity increases going down the group while lithium sodium and potassium merely burn in air rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric spontaneously catch fire in air the smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions the peroxide and superoxide due to their small size this attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom this causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium allowing them to form the less stable peroxides rubidium and caesium at the bottom of the group are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions in addition the small size of the li and ions contributes to their forming stable ionic lattice structure under controlled conditions however all the alkali metals with the exception of francium are known to form their oxides peroxides and superoxides the alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers the presence of water vapour naturally present in breath makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient all the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides mo through low temperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia they slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water potassium rubidium and caesium also form sesquioxides which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides rubidium and caesium can form great variety of suboxides with the metals in formal oxidation states below rubidium can form rb and rb copper coloured upon oxidation in air while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides such as the ozonide cso and several brightly coloured suboxides such as cs bronze cs red violet cs violet cs dark green cso cs as well as cs the last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate cs the alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known with the exception of francium reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question for example sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide na and various polysulfides with the formula na from to containing the ions due to the basicity of the se and te ions the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the and ions they may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present and are colourless water soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium the alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the po ion they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around halides hydrides and pseudohalides the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine forming salts known as the alkali metal halides the reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions all twenty stable alkali metal halides are known the unstable ones are not known with the exception of sodium astatide because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium the most well known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride otherwise known as common salt all of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula mx where is an alkali metal and is halogen they are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points all the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride lif which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy the high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the li and ions causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium the alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides where the hydride anion acts as pseudohalide these are often used as reducing agents producing hydrides complex metal hydrides or hydrogen gas other pseudohalides are also known notably the cyanides these are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely ternary alkali metal halide oxides such as na clo bro yellow na br na and br are also known the polyhalides are rather unstable although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations coordination complexes alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple lewis bases due to their low charge of just and their relatively large size thus the li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less though exceptions occur for weak complexes lithium in particular has very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from to although octahedral is its preferred mode in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes with the exception of the lithium ion which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes li the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules because of this anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers crown for li crown for na crown for and crown for rb and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction ammonia solutions the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation and solvated electron which react to form hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide mnh where represents an alkali metal this was first noted by humphry davy in and rediscovered by weyl in the process may be speeded up by catalyst similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium strontium barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium the amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals in charles krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions at low concentrations below the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride at higher concentrations above the solution is copper coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury in addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation the neutral alkali metal atom diatomic alkali metal molecules and alkali metal anions these are unstable and eventually become the more stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis organometallic organolithium butyllithium hexamer li the aggregates are held together by delocalised covalent bonds between lithium and the terminal carbon of the butyl chain there is no direct lithium lithium bonding in any organolithium compound solid phenyllithium forms monoclinic crystals can be described as consisting of dimeric li subunits the lithium atoms and the ipso carbons of the phenyl rings form planar four membered ring the plane of the phenyl groups are perpendicular to the plane of this li ring additional strong intermolecular bonding occurs between these phenyllithium dimers and the electrons of the phenyl groups in the adjacent dimers resulting in an infinite polymeric ladder structure being the smallest alkali metal lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds which are bonded covalently organolithium compounds are electrically non conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures and tend to form oligomers with the structure rli where is the organic group as the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom effectively creating carbanion organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles for use as bases butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available an example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ch li which exists in tetrameric tetrahedral and hexameric octahedral forms organolithium compounds especially butyllithium are useful reagents in organic synthesis as might be expected given lithium diagonal relationship with magnesium which plays an important role in the grignard reaction for example alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls the reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl for example proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde using as the electrophile or ketone using an alkyl halide product lir ni co li rconi co li rconi co li rcho solvent ni co li rconi co li cor solvent ni co alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with disubstituted amides to give aldehydes and ketones and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide they thermally decompose to eliminate hydrogen producing alkenes and lithium hydride another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl and aryllithiums that act as strong bases in non polar solvents aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids arco and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols ar ar oh finally they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal halogen exchange heavier alkali metals unlike the organolithium compounds the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic the application of organosodium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity the principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium sodium can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility notable reagent is schlosser base mixture of butyllithium and potassium tert butoxide this reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium kch chch cis butene and trans butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium it is slow with the heavier alkali metals the heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported establishing that they like the sodium compounds are polymeric organosodium organopotassium organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble or nearly so in nonpolar solvents alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air they cause the cleavage of ethers generating alkoxides unlike alkyllithium compounds alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because wurtz coupling occurs rm mx as such they have to be made by reacting alkylmercury compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents while methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations the alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons for example and terminal alkynes to give salts liquid ammonia ether or hydrocarbon solvents are used the most common of which being tetrahydrofuran the most important of these compounds is sodium nac an important precursor to many transition metal derivatives similarly the alkali metals react with in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal for example dipotassium is an important precursor to many metal derivatives such as uranocene the large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large aromatic polarisable radical anions such as the dark green sodium naphthalenide na strong reducing agent representative reactions of alkali metals reaction with oxygen upon reacting with oxygen alkali metals form oxides peroxides superoxides and suboxides

known as birch reduction other reductions that can be carried by these solutions are fe co fe co co extensions empirical na cs mg ra and predicted fr uhp ubn uhh atomic radius of the alkali and alkaline earth metals from the third to the ninth period measured in angstroms although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of hypothetical heavier alkali metals being the first period element the undiscovered element ununennium element is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners however it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium this is unusual as periodic trends ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium this lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium valence electron increasing ununennium first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii this effect is already seen for francium this assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal which although likely may not be true due to relativistic effects the relativistic stabilisation of the orbital also increases ununennium electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium indeed ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it relativistic effects also cause very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium on the other hand ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group being expected to have melting point between and eighth period measured in electron volts the stabilisation of ununennium valence electron and thus the contraction of the orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to pm very close to that of rubidium pm so that the chemistry of ununennium in the oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium on the other hand the ionic radius of the uue ion is predicted to be larger than that of rb because the orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the orbitals of the lower shells ununennium may also show the oxidation state which is not seen in any other alkali metal in addition to the oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the spinor causing its outermost electrons to have lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected indeed many ununennium compounds are expected to have large covalent character due to the involvement of the electrons in the bonding empirical na fr mg ra and predicted uue uhp ubn uhh ionisation energy of the alkali and alkaline earth metals from the third to the ninth period measured in electron volts not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium although simple extrapolation of the periodic table by the aufbau principle would put element unhexennium under ununennium dirac fock calculations predict that the next element after ununennium with alkali metal like properties may be element unhexpentium which is predicted to have the electron configuration og this element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and group element and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium however the electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the electron possibly allowing oxidation states beyond whence the likely transition metal behaviour of unhexpentium due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being block elements these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium ubn and unhexhexium uhh unsepttrium element may be an even better heavier homologue of ununennium with predicted electron configuration of usb it returns to the alkali metal like situation of having one easily removed electron far above closed shell in energy and is expected to be even more reactive than caesium the probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unsepttrium have not been explored yet as of and they may or may not be able to exist in periods and above of the periodic table relativistic and shell structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate in addition the relativistic and shell structure effects which stabilise the orbitals and destabilise and expand the and orbitals of higher shells have opposite effects causing even larger difference between relativistic and non relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers interest in the chemical properties of ununennium unhexpentium and unsepttrium stems from the fact that they are located close to the expected locations of islands of stability centered at elements ubb and uhq pseudo alkali metals many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations analogously to the pseudohalogens they have sometimes been called pseudo alkali metals these substances include some elements and many more polyatomic ions the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power hydrogen the element hydrogen with one electron per neutral atom is usually placed at the top of group of the periodic table for convenience but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal when it is considered to be an alkali metal it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties under typical conditions pure hydrogen exists as diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule however the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules such as dilithium li at high temperatures when they are in the gaseous state hydrogen like the alkali metals has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens but the similarities end there because of the small size of bare proton compared to the alkali metal cations its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration it is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties the first ionisation energy of hydrogen kj mol is much higher than that of the alkali metals as only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom hydrogen often behaves like halogen forming the negative hydride ion and is very occasionally considered to be halogen on that basis the alkali metals can also form negative ions known as alkalides but these are little more than laboratory curiosities being unstable an argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens the radius of the anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens indeed is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons it was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties while this has been shown to not be the case under extremely high pressures such as those found at the cores of jupiter and saturn hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal in this phase it is known as metallic hydrogen the electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at at the respective pressures when they undergo nonmetal to metal transition the electron configuration of hydrogen while superficially similar to that of the alkali metals ns is unique because there is no subshell hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron or gain one to form the hydride ion in the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals in the latter case the halogens but the differences due to the lack of subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well group is also good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity but hydrogen cannot be tetravalent thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory although group is the most common placement if one is chosen because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species being the foundation of acid base chemistry as an example of hydrogen unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size the hydrogen ion is very small radius around fm compared to the pm size of most other atoms and ions and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules indeed transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid base chemistry also unique is hydrogen ability to form hydrogen bonds which are an effect of charge transfer electrostatic and electron correlative contributing phenomena while analogous lithium bonds are also known they are mostly electrostatic nevertheless hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals and has close relationship with the lightest alkali metals especially lithium ammonium and derivatives similarly to the alkali metals ammonia reacts with hydrochloric acid to form the salt ammonium chloride the ammonium ion has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium and is often considered close relative for example most alkali metal salts are soluble in water property which ammonium salts share ammonium is expected to behave stably as metal ions in sea of delocalised electrons at very high pressures though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around gpa and could possibly occur inside the ice giants uranus and neptune which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields it has been estimated that the transition from mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below gpa under standard conditions ammonium can form metallic amalgam with mercury other pseudo alkali metals include the alkylammonium cations in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups in particular the quaternary ammonium cations are very useful since they are permanently charged and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive cs to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as hydroxides like alkali metal hydroxides are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates furthermore the nitrogen atom may be replaced by phosphorus arsenic or antimony atom the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens creating phosphonium or arsonium cation that can itself be substituted similarly while stibonium itself is not known some of its organic derivatives are characterised cobaltocene and derivatives cobaltocene co is metallocene the cobalt analogue of ferrocene it is dark purple solid cobaltocene has valence electrons one more than usually found in metal complexes such as its very stable relative ferrocene in accordance with the electron rule this additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the co bonds consequently many chemical reactions of co are characterized by its tendency to lose this extra electron yielding very stable electron cation known as cobaltocenium many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts and cobaltocenium hydroxide is strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate like the alkali metals cobaltocene is strong reducing agent and is stronger still due to the combined inductive effect of the ten methyl groups cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene an even stronger reducing agent iridocene involving iridium would presumably be still more potent but is not very well studied due to its instability thallium very pure thallium pieces in glass ampoule stored under argon gas thallium is the heaviest stable element in group of the periodic table at the bottom of the periodic table the inert pair effect is quite strong because of the relativistic stabilisation of the orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the electrons it displays the oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display and thallium compounds with thallium in its oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds due to the similar ionic radii of the tl pm pm and ag pm ions it was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental europe but not in england in the years immediately following its discovery and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in dmitri mendeleev periodic table and julius lothar meyer periodic table mendeleev periodic table and meyer periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank however thallium also displays the oxidation state which no known alkali metal displays although ununennium the undiscovered seventh alkali metal is predicted to possibly display the oxidation state the sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium while tl is stabilised by the inert pair effect this inert pair of electrons is still able to participate chemically so that these electrons are active in aqueous solution additionally the thallium halides except tlf are quite insoluble in water and tli has an unusual structure because of the presence of the active inert pair in thallium copper silver and gold the group metals or coinage metals copper silver and gold are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete shells physically they have the relatively low melting points and high values associated with post transition metals the filled subshell and free electron of cu ag and au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity transition metals to the left of group experience interactions between electrons and the partially filled subshell that lower electron mobility chemically the group metals behave like main group metals in their valence states and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals this is one reason for their previously being labelled as group ib paralleling the alkali metals group ia they are occasionally classified as post transition metals their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals their monopositive ions are paramagnetic and contribute no colour to their salts like those of the alkali metals in mendeleev periodic table copper silver and gold are listed twice once under group viii with the iron triad and platinum group metals and once under group ib group ib was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative mendeleev main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element on that basis the group elements could not be classified in group ib due to the existence of copper ii and gold iii compounds being known at that time however eliminating group ib would make group the only main group group viii was labelled transition group to lack an bifurcation soon afterward majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group ib and remove them from group viii for the resulting symmetry this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium long column periodic table which separated the alkali metals and group metals the coinage metals were traditionally regarded as subdivision of the alkali metal group due to them sharing the characteristic electron configuration of the alkali metals group group however the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the compounds of both groups and not their chemical properties this stems from the filled subshell providing much weaker shielding effect on the outermost electron than the filled subshell so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals furthermore they have higher melting points hardnesses and densities and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia as well as having more covalent character in their compounds finally the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom the coinage metals filled shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals filled shell so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower enabling higher oxidation states than and richer coordination chemistry thus giving the group metals clear transition metal character particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium in which it forms the auride ion au which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution here gold behaves as pseudohalogen because its configuration has one electron less than the quasi closed shell configuration of mercury production and isolation the production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances such as water from their silicate ores all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium iii ions from the ore leaching whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide the remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride the result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture the heavier alkali metals however is more typically isolated in different way where reducing agent typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride the liquid or gaseous product the alkali metal then undergoes fractional distillation for purification most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity one of the few which does not is the pyrolysis of the corresponding alkali metal azide which yields the metal for sodium potassium rubidium and caesium and the nitride for lithium lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs brine pools and brine deposits the metal is produced from mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below through the use of downs cell extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide potassium occurs in many minerals such as sylvite potassium chloride previously potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide found extensively in places such as canada russia belarus germany israel united states and jordan in method similar to how sodium was produced in the late and early it can also be produced from seawater however these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures potentially forming the explosive superoxide as result pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at na kcl nacl although sodium is less reactive than potassium this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion this sample of alt shiny gray centimeter piece of matter with rough surface for several years in the and by product of the potassium production called alkarb was main source for rubidium alkarb contained rubidium while the rest was potassium and small fraction of caesium today the largest producers of caesium for example the tanco mine in manitoba canada produce rubidium as by product from pollucite today common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallisation of rubidium and caesium alum cs rb al so which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately the limited applications and the lack of mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to to tonnes per year caesium however is not produced from the above reaction instead the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium extracted from the ore mainly by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction both metals are produced as by products of lithium production after when interest in lithium thermonuclear properties increased sharply the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at and low pressure as result of its extreme rarity in nature most francium is synthesised in the nuclear reaction au fr yielding francium francium and francium the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about neutral atoms which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above when the only natural isotope francium is specifically required it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium one of the daughters of natural uranium applications focs caesium atomic clock in switzerland lithium sodium and potassium have many applications while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet lithium is often used in lithium ion batteries and lithium oxide can help process silica lithium stearate is thickener and can be used to make lubricating greases it is produced from lithium hydroxide which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines lithium chloride is used as brazing alloy for aluminium parts metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys sodium compounds have many applications the most well known being sodium chloride as table salt sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap pure sodium metal also has many applications including use in sodium vapour lamps which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting and can help smooth the surface of other metals being strong reducing agent it is often used to reduce many other metals such as titanium and zirconium from their chlorides furthermore it is very useful as heat exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point viscosity and cross section towards neutron absorption potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition potassium hydroxide is very strong base and is used to control the ph of various substances potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate are often used as powerful oxidising agents potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas pure potassium metal is not often used but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate if clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs it would be off by less than four seconds after million years for that reason caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry francium has no commercial applications but because of francium relatively simple atomic structure among other things it has been used in spectroscopy experiments leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles studies on the light emitted by laser trapped francium ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels similar to those predicted by quantum theory biological role and precautions metals pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat fire oxidising agents acids most organic compounds halocarbons plastics and moisture they also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride so that normal fire extinguishers are when used on alkali metal fires some class dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of few grams in fume hood small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol the alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere the inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas except for lithium which reacts with nitrogen rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air even under oil because even small amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide for the same reason potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen containing atmosphere for longer than months ions lithium carbonate the bioinorganic chemistry of the alkali metal ions has been extensively reviewed solid state crystal structures have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides nucleic acid constituents carbohydrates and ionophore complexes lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role but does have effects on the body when ingested lithium carbonate is used as mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder manic depression in daily doses of about to grams although there are side effects excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness slurred speech and vomiting among other symptoms and poisons the central nervous system which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage its biochemistry the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume blood pressure osmotic equilibrium and ph the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is milligrams per day sodium chloride also known as common salt is the principal source of sodium in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative such as for pickling and jerky most of it comes from processed foods the dietary reference intake for sodium is grams per day but most people in the united states consume more than grams per day the minimum amount that promotes hypertension this in turn causes million premature deaths worldwide potassium is the major cation positive ion inside animal cells while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells the concentration differences of these charged particles causes difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells known as the membrane potential the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in the cell membrane the cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential spike of electrical discharge the ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as muscle contraction and heart function disruption of this balance may thus be fatal for example ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions wheel type radiotherapy device which has long collimator to focus the radiation into narrow beam the caesium chloride radioactive source is the blue square and gamma rays are represented by the beam emerging from the aperture this was the radiation source involved in the goiânia accident containing about grams of caesium chloride due to their similar atomic radii rubidium and caesium in the body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly rubidium has no known biological role but may help stimulate metabolism and similarly to caesium replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency partial substitution is quite possible and rather non toxic kg person contains on average of rubidium and an increase in this value by to times did not show negative effects in test persons rats can survive up to substitution of potassium by rubidium rubidium and to much lesser extent caesium can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems caesium is never able to do so there is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats even if this is true the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic like rubidium caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body but is significantly larger and is therefore poorer substitute excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia arrythmia and acute cardiac arrest but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources as such caesium is not major chemical environmental pollutant the median lethal dose ld value for caesium chloride in mice is per kilogram which is comparable to the ld values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy but has been linked to the deaths of over patients on whom it was used as part of scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions the improper handling of caesium gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries perhaps the best known case is the goiânia accident of in which an improperly disposed of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of goiânia brazil was scavenged from junkyard and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious uneducated buyers this led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure together with caesium iodine and strontium caesium was among the isotopes distributed by the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half life but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk notes references
charles morton updated version of edward bernard orbis eruditi comparing all known alphabets as of an alphabet is standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes called letters that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages not all writing systems represent language in this way in syllabary each character represents syllable for instance and logographic systems use characters to represent words morphemes or other semantic units the first fully phonemic script the proto canaanite script later known as the phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets including arabic cyrillic greek hebrew latin and possibly brahmic it was created by semitic speaking workers and slaves in the sinai peninsula as the proto sinaitic script by selecting small number of hieroglyphs commonly seen in their egyptian surroundings to describe the sounds as opposed to the semantic values of their own canaanite language peter daniels however distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels as in devanagari and other south asian scripts an abjad in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants as in the original phoenician hebrew or arabic and an alphabet set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants in this narrow sense of the word the first true alphabet was the greek alphabet which was developed on the basis of the earlier phoenician alphabet of the dozens of alphabets in use today the most popular is the latin alphabet which was derived from the greek and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks while most alphabets have letters composed of lines linear writing there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in braille the khmer alphabet for cambodian is the longest with letters alphabets are usually associated with standard ordering of letters this makes them useful for purposes of collation specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order it also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of numbering ordered items in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements etymology the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος alphabētos the greek word was made from the first two letters alpha and beta the names for the greek letters came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet aleph which also meant ox and bet which also meant house sometimes like in the alphabet song in english the term abcs is used instead of the word alphabet now know my abcs knowing one abcs in general can be used as metaphor for knowing the basics about anything history specimen of typeset fonts and languages by william caslon letter founder from the cyclopaedia ancient northeast african and middle eastern scripts the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt egyptian writing had set of some hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals to represent syllables that begin with single consonant of their language plus vowel or no vowel to be supplied by the native speaker these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms to write grammatical inflections and later to transcribe loan words and foreign names specimen of proto sinaitic script one of the earliest if not the very first phonemic scripts in the middle bronze age an apparently alphabetic system known as the proto sinaitic script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the th century bc apparently left by canaanite workers in john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi el hol dated to circa bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa bc strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time based on letter appearances and names it is believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs this script had no characters representing vowels although originally it probably was syllabary but unneeded symbols were discarded an alphabetic cuneiform script with signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the th century bc this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit the proto sinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet which is conventionally called proto canaanite before ca bc the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram this script is the parent script of all western alphabets by the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely canaanite and aramaic the aramaic gave rise to the hebrew script the south arabian alphabet sister script to the phoenician alphabet is the script from which the ge ez alphabet an abugida is descended vowelless alphabets are called abjads currently exemplified in scripts including arabic hebrew and syriac the omission of vowels was not always satisfactory solution and some weak consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of syllable matres lectionis these letters have dual function since they are also used as pure consonants the proto sinaitic or proto canaanite script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with limited number of signs in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs and linear the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters making it script simple enough for common traders to learn another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages since it recorded words phonemically illustration from acta eruditorum the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean in greece the script was modified to add vowels giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west it was the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in greek to represent vowels vowels are significant in the greek language and the syllabical linear script that was used by the mycenaean greeks from the th century bc had symbols including vowels in its early years there were many variants of the greek alphabet situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it european alphabets codex zographensis in the glagolitic alphabet from medieval bulgaria the greek alphabet in its euboean form was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula where it gave rise to variety of alphabets used to write the italic languages one of these became the latin alphabet which was spread across europe as the romans expanded their empire even after the fall of the roman state the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works it eventually became used for the descendant languages of latin the romance languages and then for most of the other languages of europe some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures such as in danish and icelandic and in algonquian by borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn in old english and icelandic which came from the futhark runes and by modifying existing letters such as the eth of old english and icelandic which is modified other alphabets only use subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian and italian which uses the letters and only in foreign words another notable script is elder futhark which is believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabets elder futhark gave rise to variety of alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabets the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from ad to the late middle ages its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the th century the old hungarian script is contemporary writing system of the hungarians it was in use during the entire history of hungary albeit not as an official writing system from the th century it once again became more and more popular the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became together with the greek uncial script the basis of the cyrillic script cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union cyrillic alphabets include the serbian macedonian bulgarian russian belarusian and ukrainian the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius while the cyrillic alphabet was invented by clement of ohrid who was their disciple they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the greek alphabet and the hebrew alphabet the longest european alphabet is the latin derived slovak alphabet which has letters asian alphabets beyond the logographic chinese writing many phonetic scripts are in existence in asia the arabic alphabet hebrew alphabet syriac alphabet and other abjads of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia are descended from the brahmi script which is often believed to be descendant of aramaic zhuyin on cell phone in korea the hangul alphabet was created by sejong the great hangul is unique alphabet it is featural alphabet where many of the letters are designed from sound place of articulation to look like the widened mouth to look like the tongue pulled in etc its design was planned by the government of the day and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions in the same way as chinese characters to allow for mixed script writing one syllable always takes up one type space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound block zhuyin sometimes called bopomofo is semi syllabary used to phonetically transcribe mandarin chinese in the republic of china after the later establishment of the people republic of china and its adoption of hanyu pinyin the use of zhuyin today is limited but it is still widely used in taiwan where the republic of china still governs zhuyin developed out of form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early and has elements of both an alphabet and syllabary like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols but like syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not rather each possible final excluding the medial glide is represented by its own symbol for example luan is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ an where the last symbol represents the entire final an while zhuyin is not used as mainstream writing system it is still often used in ways similar to romanization system that is for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones european alphabets especially latin and cyrillic have been adapted for many languages of asia arabic is also widely used sometimes as an abjad as with urdu and persian and sometimes as complete alphabet as with kurdish and uyghur types the term alphabet is used by linguists and paleographers in both wide and narrow sense in the wider sense an alphabet is script that is segmental at the phoneme level that is it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other types of segmental script abjads and abugidas these three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed abugidas are also consonant based but indicate vowels with diacritics to or systematic graphic modification of the consonants in alphabets in the narrow sense on the other hand consonants and vowels are written as independent letters the earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the wadi el hol script believed to be an abjad which through its successor phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets including arabic greek latin via the old italic alphabet cyrillic via the greek alphabet and hebrew via aramaic examples of present day abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic and korean hangul and abugidas are used to write tigrinya amharic hindi and thai the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than syllabary as their name would imply since each glyph stands for consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel in true syllabary each consonant vowel combination would be represented by separate glyph all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs ugaritic for example is basically an abjad but has syllabic letters for these are the only time vowels are indicated cyrillic is basically true alphabet but has syllabic letters for coptic has letter for devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels though some traditions use as zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear cut for example sorani kurdish is written in the arabic script which is normally an abjad however in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and full letters are used so the script is true alphabet other languages may use semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks although short was not written as in the indic abugidas one could argue that the linear arrangement made this true alphabet conversely the vowel marks of the tigrinya abugida and the amharic abugida ironically the original source of the term abugida have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as syllabary rather than as segmental script even more extreme the pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic see below ge ez script of ethiopia and eritrea thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels for tonal languages further classification can be based on their treatment of tone though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry heavy functional load as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels most commonly tones are indicated with diacritics the way vowels are treated in abugidas this is the case for vietnamese true alphabet and thai an abugida in thai tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant with diacritics for disambiguation in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone more rarely script may have separate letters for tones as is the case for hmong and zhuang for most of these scripts regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked but there is diacritic to indicate lack of tone like the virama of indic the number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small the book pahlavi script an abjad had only twelve letters at one point and may have had even fewer later on today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small but it actually consists of letters including the ʻokina and five long vowels however hawaiian braille has only letters while rotokas has small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent just eleven book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated that is the graphic distinctions had been lost over time and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes for example comma shaped letter represented or however such apparent simplifications can perversely make script more complicated in later pahlavi papyri up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost and the script could no longer be read as sequence of letters at all but instead each word had to be learned as whole that is they had become logograms as in egyptian demotic venn diagram showing the greek left cyrillic bottom and latin right alphabets which share many of the same letters although they have different pronunciations the largest segmental script is probably an abugida devanagari when written in devanagari vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of letters including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for kš and jñ though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary and so has been expanded to with the khutma letters letters with dot added to represent sounds from persian and english thai has total of symbols consisting of consonants vowels and syllabics not including diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length the largest known abjad is sindhi with letters the largest alphabets in the narrow sense include kabardian and abkhaz for cyrillic with and letters respectively and slovak for the latin script with however these scripts either count di and tri graphs as separate letters as spanish did with ch and ll until recently or uses diacritics like slovak the georgian alphabet is an alphabetic writing system with letters it is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent the original georgian alphabet had letters but letters were removed in the th century by ilia chavchavadze the georgian alphabet is much closer to greek than the other caucasian alphabets the letter order parallels the greek with the consonants without greek equivalent organized at the end of the alphabet the origins of the alphabet are still unknown some armenian and western scholars believe it was created by mesrop mashtots armenian մեսրոպ մաշտոց mesrop maštoc also known as mesrob the vartabed who was an early medieval armenian linguist theologian statesman and hymnologist best known for inventing the armenian alphabet ad other georgian and western scholars are against this theory most scholars link the creation of the georgian script to the process of of iberia core georgian kingdom of kartli the alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of iberia under king mirian iii or and the bir el qutt inscriptions of with the armenian alphabet syllabaries typically contain to glyphs and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands thus simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script the armenian alphabet or is graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the armenian language it was created in year originally contained letters two more letters and were added in the middle ages during the orthography reform new letter capital եվ was added which was ligature before while the letter was discarded and reintroduced as part of new letter ու ու which was digraph before old georgian alphabet inscription on monastery gate the armenian script directionality is horizontal left to right like the latin and greek alphabets it also uses bicameral script like those the armenian word for alphabet is named after the first two letters of the armenian alphabet այբ ayb and բեն ben alphabetical order alphabets often come to be associated with standard ordering of their letters which can then be used for purposes of collation namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called alphabetical order the basic ordering of the latin alphabet which is derived from the northwest semitic abgad order is well established although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters such as the french and and of certain combinations of letters multigraphs in french these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation however in icelandic the accented letters such as and are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts in spanish is considered separate letter but accented vowels such as and are not the ll and ch were also considered single letters but in the real academia española changed the collating order so that ll is between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch is between cg and ci and in the tenth congress of the association of spanish language academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all in german words starting with sch which spells the german phoneme are inserted between words with initial sca and sci all incidentally loanwords instead of appearing after initial sz as though it were single letter in contrast to several languages such as albanian in which dh gj ll rr th xh and zh all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters would follow the letters and respectively as well as hungarian and welsh further german words with an umlaut are collated ignoring the umlaut contrary to turkish that adopted the graphemes and and where word like tüfek would come after tuz in the dictionary an exception is the german telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like ae since names such as jäger also appear with the spelling jaeger and are not distinguished in the spoken language the danish and norwegian alphabets end with whereas the swedish and finnish ones conventionally put at the end it is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had defined sequence some alphabets today such as the hanuno script are learned one letter at time in no particular order and are not used for collation where definite order is required however dozen ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century bc preserve the alphabet in two sequences one the abcde order later used in phoenician has continued with minor changes in hebrew greek armenian gothic cyrillic and latin the other hmħlq was used in southern arabia and is preserved today in ethiopic both orders have therefore been stable for at least years runic used an unrelated futhark sequence which was later simplified arabic uses its own sequence although arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering the brahmic family of alphabets used in india use unique order based on phonology the letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth this organization is used in southeast asia tibet korean hangul and even japanese kana which is not an alphabet names of letters the phoenician letter names in which each letter was associated with word that begins with that sound acrophony continue to be used to varying degrees in samaritan aramaic syriac hebrew greek and arabic the names were abandoned in latin which instead referred to the letters by adding vowel usually before or after the consonant the two exceptions were and which were borrowed from the greek alphabet rather than etruscan and were known as graeca greek pronounced graeca greek and zeta from greek this discrepancy was inherited by many european languages as in the term zed for in all forms of english other than american english over time names sometimes shifted or were added as in double for double in french the english name for and american zee for comparing names in english and french gives clear reflection of the great vowel shift and are pronounced in today english but in contemporary french they are the french names from which the english names are derived preserve the qualities of the english vowels from before the great vowel shift by contrast the names of and remain the same in both languages because short vowels were largely unaffected by the shift in cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on slavic words this was later abandoned as well in favor of system similar to that used in latin letters of armenian alphabet also have distinct letter names orthography and pronunciation when an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent given language an orthography generally comes into being providing rules for the spelling of words in that language in accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes significant sounds of the spoken language in perfectly phonemic orthography there would be consistent one to one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes so that writer could predict the spelling of word given its pronunciation and speaker would always know the pronunciation of word given its spelling and vice versa however this ideal is not usually achieved in practice some languages such as spanish and finnish come close to it while others such as english deviate from it to much larger degree the pronunciation of language often evolves independently of its writing system and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of language varies greatly from one language to another and even within single language languages may fail to achieve one to one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways language may represent given phoneme by combination of letters rather than just single letter two letter combinations are called digraphs and three letter groups are called trigraphs german uses the tetragraphs four letters tsch for the phoneme and in few borrowed words dsch for kabardian also uses tetragraph for one of its phonemes namely кхъу two letters representing one sound occur in several instances in hungarian as well where for instance cs stands for tʃ sz for zs for dzs for dʒ language may represent the same phoneme with two or more different letters or combinations of letters an example is modern greek which may write the phoneme in six different ways and though the last is rare language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons for example the spelling of the thai word for beer เบ ยร retains letter for the final consonant present in the english word it was borrowed from but silences it pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in sentence sandhi different dialects of language may use different phonemes for the same word language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items such as the japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries or the various rules in english for spelling words from latin and greek or the original germanic vocabulary national languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard some national languages like finnish armenian turkish russian serbo croatian serbian croatian and bosnian and bulgarian have very regular spelling system with nearly one to one correspondence between letters and phonemes strictly speaking these national languages lack word corresponding to the verb to spell meaning to split word into its letters the closest match being verb meaning to split word into its syllables similarly the italian verb corresponding to spell out compitare is unknown to many italians because spelling is usually trivial as italian spelling is highly phonemic in standard spanish one can tell the pronunciation of word from its spelling but not vice versa as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way but given letter is consistently pronounced french with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation but its rules on pronunciation though complex are actually consistent and predictable with fair degree of accuracy at the other extreme are languages such as english where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in consistent way for english this is partly because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established and because english has acquired large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels even english has general albeit complex rules that predict pronunciation from spelling and these rules are successful most of the time rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have higher failure rate sometimes countries have the written language undergo spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself as when turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to latin based turkish alphabet the standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language independently of orthography is called the international phonetic alphabet

an explanation of the superscripts and subscripts seen in atomic number notation atomic number is the number of protons and therefore also the total positive charge in the atomic nucleus the rutherford bohr model of the hydrogen atom or hydrogen like ion in this model it is an essential feature that the photon energy or frequency of the electromagnetic radiation emitted shown when an electron jumps from one orbital to another be proportional to the mathematical square of atomic charge experimental measurement by henry moseley of this radiation for many elements from showed the results as predicted by bohr both the concept of atomic number and the bohr model were thereby given scientific credence the atomic number or proton number symbol of chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element the atomic number uniquely identifies chemical element it is identical to the charge number of the nucleus in an uncharged atom the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons the sum of the atomic number and the number of neutrons gives the mass number of an atom since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass the atomic mass of any atom when expressed in unified atomic mass units making quantity called the relative isotopic mass is within of the whole number atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers and hence different mass numbers are known as isotopes little more than three quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as mixture of isotopes see monoisotopic elements and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element called the relative atomic mass in defined environment on earth determines the element standard atomic weight historically it was these atomic weights of elements in comparison to hydrogen that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the th century the conventional symbol comes from the german word meaning number which before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an element numerical place in the periodic table whose order is approximately but not completely consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights only after with the suggestion and evidence that this number was also the nuclear charge and physical characteristic of atoms did the word and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use in this context history the periodic table and natural number for each element russian chemist dmitri mendeleev creator of the periodic table loosely speaking the existence or construction of periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements and so they can be numbered in order dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables first published on march in order of atomic weight atomgewicht however in consideration of the elements observed chemical properties he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium atomic weight ahead of iodine atomic weight this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number but that number was not known or suspected at the time simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory however besides the case of iodine and tellurium later several other pairs of elements such as argon and potassium cobalt and nickel were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements whose atomic number was not obvious led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium element onward hafnium was not known at this time niels bohr creator of the bohr model the rutherford bohr model and van den broek in ernest rutherford gave model of the atom in which central nucleus held most of the atom mass and positive charge which in units of the electron charge was to be approximately equal to half of the atom atomic weight expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight though it was almost different from the atomic number of gold the single element from which rutherford made his guess nevertheless in spite of rutherford estimation that gold had central charge of about but was element on the periodic table month after rutherford paper appeared antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table also known as element number atomic number and symbolized this proved eventually to be the case moseley experiment henry moseley in his lab the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in moseley after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab and who had used van den broek hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom decided to test van den broek and bohr hypothesis directly by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theory postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of to do this moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions and lines produced by the elements from aluminum to gold used as series of movable anodic targets inside an ray tube the square root of the frequency of these photons increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression this led to the conclusion moseley law that the atomic number does closely correspond with an offset of one unit for lines in moseley work to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus the element number among other things moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive must have members no fewer and no more which was far from obvious from known chemistry at that time missing elements after moseley death in the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium were examined by his method there were seven elements with which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered corresponding to atomic numbers and from to all seven of these missing elements were discovered by this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium the proton and the idea of nuclear electrons in the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of which were now recognized to be the same as the element number was not understood an old idea called prout hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues or protyles of the lightest element hydrogen which in the bohr rutherford model had single electron and nuclear charge of one however as early as rutherford and thomas royds had shown that alpha particles which had charge of were the nuclei of helium atoms which had mass four times that of hydrogen not two times if prout hypothesis were true something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms in rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas and believed he had proven prout law he called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in alternate names being proutons and protyles it had been immediately apparent from the work of moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei and thus there was required hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two nuclear electrons electrons bound inside the nucleus to cancel two of the charges at the other end of the periodic table nucleus of gold with mass times that of hydrogen was thought to contain nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it residual charge of consistent with its atomic number the discovery of the neutron makes the proton number all consideration of nuclear electrons ended with james chadwick discovery of the neutron in an atom of gold now was seen as containing neutrons rather than nuclear electrons and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from content of protons after therefore an element atomic number was also realized to be identical to the proton number of its nuclei the symbol of the conventional symbol possibly comes from the german word atomic number however prior to the word zahl simply number was used for an element assigned number in the periodic table chemical properties each element has specific set of chemical properties as consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom which is the atomic number the configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics the number of electrons in each element electron shells particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with given atomic number new elements the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers as of all elements with atomic numbers to have been observed synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created in general the half life becomes shorter as atomic number increases though an island of stability may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons see also atomic theory chemical element effective atomic number

one of the large detailed illustrations in andreas vesalius de humani corporis fabrica th century marking the rebirth of anatomy px anatomy greek anatomē dissection is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts anatomy is branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things it is an old science having its beginnings in prehistoric times anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology embryology comparative anatomy evolutionary biology and phylogeny as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated both over immediate and long term timescales anatomy and physiology which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively make natural pair of related disciplines and are often studied together human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic macroscopic anatomy or gross anatomy is the examination of an animal body parts using unaided eyesight gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures known as histology and also in the study of cells the history of anatomy is characterized by progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body methods have also improved dramatically advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers corpses to th century medical imaging techniques including ray ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging definition dissected body lying prone on table by charles landseer derived from the greek anatomē dissection from anatémnō cut up cut open from ἀνά aná up and τέμνω témnō cut anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems organs and tissues it includes the appearance and position of the various parts the materials from which they are composed their locations and their relationships with other parts anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved for example an anatomist is concerned with the shape size position structure blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver while physiologist is interested in the production of bile the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions the discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy the study by sight of the external body features microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on microscopic scale along with histology the study of tissues and embryology the study of an organism in its immature condition anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems methods used include dissection in which body is opened and its organs studied and endoscopy in which video camera equipped instrument is inserted through small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures angiography using rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels the term anatomy is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy however substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals the term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non human animals the structure and tissues of plants are of dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy animal tissues stylized cutaway diagram of an animal cell with flagella the kingdom animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile although some have secondarily adopted sessile lifestyle most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans they have an internal digestive chamber with one or two openings the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs and the zygotes include blastula stage in their embryonic development metazoans do not include the sponges which have cells unlike plant cells animal cells have neither cell wall nor chloroplasts vacuoles when present are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell including those found in muscles nerves and skin each typically has cell membrane formed of phospholipids cytoplasm and nucleus all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic all of triploblastic animal tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types connective epithelial muscle and nervous tissue hyaline cartilage at high magnification stain connective tissue connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place the main types are loose connective tissue adipose tissue fibrous connective tissue cartilage and bone the extracellular matrix contains proteins the chief and most abundant of which is collagen collagen plays major part in organizing and maintaining tissues the matrix can be modified to form skeleton to support or protect the body an exoskeleton is thickened rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization as in crustaceans or by the cross linking of its proteins as in insects an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals as well as in many of those less developed epithelium gastric mucosa at low magnification stain epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules with little intercellular space epithelial cells can be squamous flat cuboidal or columnar and rest on basal lamina the upper layer of the basement membrane the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells there are many different types of epithelium modified to suit particular function in the respiratory tract there is type of ciliated epithelial lining in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body keratinocytes make up to of the cells in the skin the epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of cuticle in simple animals this may just be coat of glycoproteins in more advanced animals many glands are formed of epithelial cells muscle tissue cross section through skeletal muscle and small nerve at high magnification stain muscle cells myocytes form the active contractile tissue of the body muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion either locomotion or movement within internal organs muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types smooth muscle skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically it contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over wide range of stretch lengths it is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has limited range of extension it is found in the movement of appendages and jaws obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two the filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions in higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus bladder intestines stomach oesophagus respiratory airways and blood vessels cardiac muscle is found only in the heart allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body nervous tissue nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information in some slow moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians including sea anemones and jellyfish the nerves form nerve net but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles in simple animals receptor neurons in the body wall cause local reaction to stimulus in more complex animals specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism neurons can be connected together in ganglia in higher animals specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is central nervous system brain and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system the latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle certain glands and internal organs including the stomach vertebrate anatomy mouse skull all vertebrates have similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives mostly in the embryonic stage share the major chordate characteristics stiffening rod the notochord dorsal hollow tube of nervous material the neural tube pharyngeal arches and tail posterior to the anus the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the tract is below it nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm connective tissues are derived from mesoderm and gut is derived from the endoderm at the posterior end is tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut the mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal and the anus at the base of the tail the defining characteristic of vertebrate is the vertebral column formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae in most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs however few vertebrates such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages fins or legs which may be secondarily lost the limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor this is one of the arguments put forward by charles darwin to support his theory of evolution fish anatomy cutaway diagram showing various organs of fish the body of fish is divided into head trunk and tail although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible the skeleton which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage in cartilaginous fish or bone in bony fish the main skeletal element is the vertebral column composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong the ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles the main external features of the fish the fins are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays which with the exception of the caudal fins have no direct connection with the spine they are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk the heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in single circulatory loop the eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision there is an inner ear but no external or middle ear low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish including skeletons composed of cartilage their bodies tend to be dorso ventrally flattened they usually have five pairs of gill slits and large mouth set on the underside of the head the dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales they have cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open but not swim bladder cartilaginous fish produce small number of large yolky eggs some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases the bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish they have bony skeleton are generally laterally flattened have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum and mouth at or near the tip of the snout the dermis is covered with overlapping scales bony fish have swim bladder which helps them maintain constant depth in the water column but not cloaca they mostly spawn large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column amphibian anatomy skeleton of surinam horned frog ceratophrys cornuta plastic model of frog amphibians are class of animals comprising frogs salamanders and caecilians they are tetrapods but the caecilians and few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales but contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist in frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs the feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing frogs have large eyes and no tail salamanders resemble lizards in appearance their short legs project sideways the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have long tail caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless they burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side reptile anatomy skeleton of diamondback rattlesnake reptiles are class of animals comprising turtles tuataras lizards snakes and crocodiles they are tetrapods but the snakes and few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians the teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size the surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create waterproof layer reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls the heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams the reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization with copulatory organ present in most species the eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land or develop internally in some species the bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid turtles are notable for their protective shells they have an inflexible trunk encased in horny carapace above and plastron below these are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine the neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp horny plates in aquatic species the front legs are modified into flippers tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period there is one living species sphenodon punctatus the skull has two openings fenestrae on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles and the lungs have single chamber and lack bronchi the tuatara has well developed parietal eye on its forehead lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost this results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider lizards are mostly quadrupeds with the trunk held off the ground by short sideways facing legs but few species have no limbs and resemble snakes lizards have moveable eyelids eardrums are present and some species have central parietal eye snakes are closely related to lizards having branched off from common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period and they share many of the same features the skeleton consists of skull hyoid bone spine and ribs though few species retain vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole snakes lack moveable eyelids the eyes being covered by transparent spectacle scales they do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm blooded prey crocodilians are large low slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth the head and trunk are dorso ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull the nostrils eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged unlike other reptiles crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood bird anatomy part of wing albrecht dürer birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight birds are endothermic have high metabolic rate light skeletal system and powerful muscles the long bones are thin hollow and very light air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones the sternum is wide and usually has keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused there are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into horn covered beak the eyes are relatively large particularly in nocturnal species such as owls they face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks the feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail contour feathers cover the bird surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds the only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail this produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens there are scales on the legs feet and claws on the tips of the toes mammal anatomy mammals are diverse class of animals mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings the legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk which is held well clear of the ground the bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth which are usually differentiated are coated in layer of prismatic enamel the teeth are shed once milk teeth during the animal lifetime or not at all as is the case in cetaceans mammals have three bones in the middle ear and cochlea in the inner ear they are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands producing milk to feed the young mammals breathe with lungs and have muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea mammals are amniotes and most are viviparous giving birth to live young the exception to this are the egg laying monotremes the platypus and the echidnas of australia most other mammals have placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment but in marsupials the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother pouch where it latches on to nipple and completes its development human anatomy mri scan in the human the development of skilled hand movements and increased brain size is likely to have evolved simultaneously humans have the overall body plan of mammal humans have head neck trunk which includes the thorax and abdomen two arms and hands and two legs and feet generally students of certain biological sciences paramedics prosthetists and orthotists occupational therapists nurses podiatrists and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models skeletons textbooks diagrams photographs lectures and tutorials and in addition medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers the study of microscopic anatomy or histology can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations or slides under microscope human anatomy physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically that is respectively studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systems the major anatomy textbook gray anatomy has been reorganized from systems format to regional format in line with modern teaching methods thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties such as histopathology and radiology academic anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools or teaching hospitals they are often involved in teaching anatomy and research into certain systems organs tissues or cells invertebrate anatomy head of male daphnia planktonic crustacean invertebrates constitute vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus lobster and dragonfly they constitute about of the animal species by definition none of these creatures has backbone the cells of single cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia food may be gathered by phagocytosis energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton some protozoans can form multicellular colonies metazoans are multicellular organism different groups of cells of which have separate functions the most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates the outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism an endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms sponges and some cephalopods exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods insects spiders ticks shrimps crabs lobsters calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs brachiopods and some tube building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians polyps sea anemones jellyfish and the collagenous cuticle of annelids the outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells gland cells and stinging cells there may also be protrusions such as microvilli cilia bristles spines and tubercles marcello malpighi the father of microscopical anatomy discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm he observed that when ring like portion of bark was removed on trunk swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves and being captured above the ring arthropod anatomy arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over million known invertebrate species insects possess segmented bodies supported by hard jointed outer covering the exoskeleton made mostly of chitin the segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts head thorax and an abdomen the head typically bears pair of sensory antennae pair of compound eyes one to three simple eyes ocelli and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts the thorax has three pairs of segmented legs one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings the abdomen is composed of eleven segments some of which may be fused and houses the digestive respiratory excretory and reproductive systems there is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts especially wings legs antennae and mouthparts spiders class of arachnids have four pairs of legs body of two segments cephalothorax and an abdomen spiders have no wings and no antennae they have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous they have second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax these have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs at the end of each male pedipalp is spoon shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ other branches of anatomy superficial or surface anatomy is important as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body it enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures superficial is directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively close to the surface of the body comparative anatomy relates to the comparison of anatomical structures both gross and microscopic in different animals artistic anatomy relates to anatomic studies for artistic reasons history ancient image of early rendition of anatomy findings in bce the edwin smith papyrus an ancient egyptian medical text described the heart its vessels liver spleen kidneys hypothalamus uterus and bladder and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart the ebers papyrus bce features treatise on the heart with vessels carrying all the body fluids to or from every member of the body ancient greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world over time this medical practice expanded by continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain eye liver reproductive organs and the nervous system the hellenistic egyptian city of alexandria was the stepping stone for greek anatomy and physiology alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the greeks but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers great patronage of the arts and sciences from the ptolemy rulers helped raise alexandria up further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other greek states an anatomy thangka part of desi sangye gyatso the blue beryl th century some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in hellenistic alexandria two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were herophilus and erasistratus these two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research they also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals which was considered taboo until the renaissance herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins and that the atria were parts of the heart herophilus knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain eye liver reproductive organs and nervous system and characterizing the course of disease erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain including the cavities and membranes and made distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum during his study in alexandria erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems he was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart which was then carried throughout the body his distinction between the arteries and veins the arteries carrying the air through the body while the veins carried the blood from the heart was great anatomical discovery erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart including the tricuspid during the third century greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses it was herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the seat of intellect and not cooling chamber as propounded by aristotle herophilus is also credited with describing the optic oculomotor motor division of the trigeminal facial and hypoglossal nerves surgical instruments were invented for the first time in history by abulcasis in the th century anatomy of the eye for the first time in history by hunayn ibn ishaq in the th century th century anatomical illustration great feats were made during the third century in both the digestive and reproductive systems herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands but the small intestine and liver he showed that the uterus is hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes he recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland the anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the hippocratic corpus an ancient greek medical work written by unknown authors aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins also in the th century bce herophilos and erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in alexandria during the ptolemaic dynasty in the nd century galen of pergamum an anatomist clinician writer and philosopher wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times he compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals he was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals galen drawings based mostly on dog anatomy became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years his work was known to renaissance doctors only through islamic golden age medicine until it was translated from the greek some time in the th century medieval to early modern anatomical study of the arm by leonardo da vinci about anatomical chart in vesalius epitome michiel jansz van mierevelt anatomy lesson of dr willem van der meer anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century as the historian marie boas writes progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after is startlingly rapid between and the anatomists mondino de luzzi alessandro achillini and antonio benivieni at bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times mondino anatomy of was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy it describes the body in the order followed in mondino dissections starting with the abdomen then the thorax then the head and limbs it was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century leonardo da vinci was trained in anatomy by andrea del verrocchio he made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork making many sketches of skeletal structures muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected andreas vesalius latinized from andries van wezel professor of anatomy at the university of padua is considered the founder of modern human anatomy originally from brabant vesalius published the influential book de humani corporis fabrica the structure of the human body large format book in seven volumes in the accurate and intricately detailed illustrations often in allegorical poses against italianate landscapes are thought to have been made by the artist jan van calcar pupil of titian in england anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science these were given by the company of barbers and surgeons in the th century joined in by the lumleian lectures in surgery at the royal college of physicians late modern in the united states medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the th century classes in anatomy needed continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain philadelphia baltimore and new york were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night removing newly buried corpses from their coffins similar problem existed in britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers the practice was halted in britain by the anatomy act of while in the united states similar legislation was enacted after the physician william forbes of jefferson medical college was found guilty in of complicity with in the despoliation of graves in lebanon cemetery the teaching of anatomy in britain was transformed by sir john struthers regius professor of anatomy at the university of aberdeen from to he was responsible for setting up the system of three years of pre clinical academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine including especially anatomy this system lasted until the reform of medical training in and as well as teaching he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy published over research papers and became famous for his public dissection of the tay whale from the royal college of surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy and were often used in teaching ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused he noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives the students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically an electron microscope from before the modern medical era the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection palpation and auscultation of the living it was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens the invention of the electron microscope brought great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them about the same time in the the use of ray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to new field of molecular anatomy equally important advances have occurred in non invasive techniques for examining the interior structures of the body rays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations see also anatomical model outline of human

film school student upon returning from the research expedition in tarkovsky applied at the state institute of cinematography vgik and was admitted to the film directing program he was in the same class as irma raush whom he married in april the early khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors before annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors after more films were produced many of them by young directors the khrushchev thaw relaxed soviet social restrictions bit and permitted limited influx of european and north american literature films and music this allowed tarkovsky to see films of the italian neorealists french new wave and of directors such as kurosawa buñuel bergman bresson andrzej wajda whose film ashes and diamonds influenced tarkovsky and mizoguchi tarkovsky teacher and mentor was mikhail romm who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors in tarkovsky directed his

the film committee of the council of ministers of the ussr and the union of soviet film makers expressed their sorrow that tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile posthumously he was awarded the lenin prize in one of the highest state honors in the soviet union in the andrei tarkovsky memorial prize was established with its first recipient being the russian animator yuriy norshteyn in three consecutive events the moscow international film festival awards the annual andrei tarkovsky award in the years of and in the andrei tarkovsky museum opened in yuryevets his childhood town minor planet tarkovskij discovered by soviet astronomer lyudmila georgievna karachkina in has also been named after him tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries most notable is the documentary moscow elegy by russian film director alexander sokurov sokurov own work has been heavily influenced by tarkovsky the film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from tarkovsky films directed by andrei tarkovsky is documentary film by michal leszczylowski an editor of the film the sacrifice film director chris marker produced the television documentary one day in the life of andrei arsenevich as an homage to andrei tarkovsky in ingmar bergman was quoted as saying tarkovsky for me is the greatest of us all the one who invented new language true to the nature of film as it captures life as reflection life as dream film historian steven dillon says that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of tarkovsky at the entrance to the gerasimov institute of cinematography in moscow there is monument that includes statues of tarkovsky gennady shpalikov and vasily shukshin unproduced screenplays concentrate concentrate kontsentrat is never filmed screenplay by russian film director andrei tarkovsky the screenplay is based on tarkovsky year in the taiga as member of research expedition prior to his enrollment in film school it about the leader of geological expedition who waits for the boat that brings back the concentrates collected by the expedition the expedition is surrounded by mystery and its purpose is state secret although some authors claim that the screenplay was filmed according to marina tarkovskaya tarkovsky sister and wife of aleksandr gordon fellow student of tarvosky during his film school years the screenplay was never filmed tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the state institute of cinematography vgik in single sitting he earned the highest possible grade excellent for this work in fragments of the concentrate were filmed and used in the documentary andrei tarkovsky taiga summer by marina tarkovskaya and aleksandr gordon hoffmanniana hoffmanniana is never filmed screenplay by russian film director andrei tarkovsky the screenplay is based on the life and work of german author hoffmann in an acquaintance from tallinnfilm approached tarkovsky to write screenplay on german theme tarkovsky considered thomas mann and hoffmann and also thought about ibsen peer gynt in the end tarkovsky signed contract for script based on the life and work of hoffmann tarkovsky planned to write the script during the summer of at his dacha writing was not without difficulty less than month before the deadline he had not written single page he finally finished the project in late and submitted the final script to tallinnfilm in october although the script was well received by the officials at tallinnfilm it was the consensus that no one but tarkovsky would be able to direct it the script was sent to goskino in february and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film the screenplay was never realized in during the time of his exile in the west tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made few changes he also considered to finally direct film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea influences tarkovsky became film director during the mid and late period referred to as the khrushchev thaw during which soviet society opened to foreign films literature and music among other things this allowed tarkovsky to see films of european american and japanese directors an experience that influenced his own film making his teacher and mentor at the film school mikhail romm allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director tarkovsky was according to fellow student shavkat abdusalmov fascinated by japanese films he was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of haiku and its ability to create images in such way that they mean nothing beyond themselves tarkovsky was also deeply religious orthodox christian who believed great art should have higher spiritual purpose tarkovsky was perfectionist not given to humor or humility his signature style was ponderous and literary having many characters that pondered over religious themes and issues regarding faith tarkovsky perceived that the art of cinema has only been truly mastered by very few filmmakers stating in interview with naum abramov that they can be counted on the fingers of one hand in tarkovsky told film historian leonid kozlov his ten favorite films the list includes diary of country priest and mouchette by robert bresson winter light wild strawberries and persona by ingmar bergman nazarín by luis buñuel city lights by charlie chaplin ugetsu by kenji mizoguchi seven samurai by akira kurosawa and woman in the dunes by hiroshi teshigahara among his favorite directors were buñuel mizoguchi bergman bresson kurosawa michelangelo antonioni jean vigo and carl theodor dreyer with the exception of city lights the list does not contain any films of the early silent era the reason is that tarkovsky saw film as an art as only relatively recent phenomenon with the early film making forming only prelude the list has also no films or directors from tarkovsky native russia although he rated soviet directors such as boris barnet sergei parajanov and alexander dovzhenko highly he said of dovzhenko earth have lived lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people they spread calmness had such tact they conveyed feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that have seldom come across on such scale dovzhenko had obviously understood wherein the sense of life resides this trespassing of the border between nature and mankind is an ideal place for the existence of man dovzhenko understood this andrei tarkovsky was not fan of science fiction largely dismissing it for its comic book trappings and vulgar commercialism however in famous exception tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film the terminator saying that its vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art he was critical of the brutality and low acting skills but was nevertheless impressed by the film cinematic style in interview tarkovsky argued all art of course is intellectual but for me all the arts and cinema even more so must above all be emotional and act upon the heart his films are characterized by metaphysical themes extremely long takes and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty recurring motifs are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors reflections levitation and characters re appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera he once said juxtaposing person with an environment that is boundless collating him with countless number of people passing by close to him and far away relating person to the whole world that is the meaning of cinema tarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films most notably solaris to him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability water clouds and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value as well as their symbolism such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water bells and candles are also frequent symbols these are symbols of film sight and sound and tarkovsky film frequently has themes of self reflection tarkovsky developed theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as medium was to take our experience of time and alter it unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time by using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another up to and including his film mirror tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory after mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle concentrated action happening in one place within the span of single day several of tarkovsky films have color or black and white sequences this first occurs in the otherwise monochrome andrei rublev which features color epilogue of rublev authentic religious icon paintings all of his films afterwards contain monochrome and in stalker case sepia sequences while otherwise being in color in in an interview conducted shortly after finishing andrei rublev tarkovsky dismissed color film as commercial gimmick and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color he claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments but not all the time as this distracts the viewer to him films in color were like moving paintings or photographs which are too beautiful to be realistic depiction of life bergman on tarkovsky ingmar bergman renowned director commented on tarkovsky contrarily however bergman conceded the truth in the claim made by critic who wrote that with autumn sonata bergman does bergman adding tarkovsky began to make tarkovsky films and that fellini began to make fellini films buñuel nearly always made buñuel films this pastiche of one own work has been derogatorily termed as self karaoke vadim yusov tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer vadim yusov from to and much of the visual style of tarkovsky films can be attributed to this collaboration tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for yusov to film single long take and due to the preparation usually only single take was needed sven nykvist in his last film the sacrifice tarkovsky worked with cinematographer sven nykvist who had worked on many films with director ingmar bergman nykvist was not alone several people involved in the production had previously collaborated with bergman notably lead actor erland josephson who had also acted for tarkovsky in nostalghia nykvist complained that tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it but ultimately stated that choosing to work with tarkovsky was one of the best choices he had ever made filmography tarkovsky is mainly known as film director during his career he directed seven feature films as well as three shorts from his time at vgik his features are ivan childhood andrei rublev solaris mirror stalker nostalghia the sacrifice he also wrote several screenplays furthermore he directed the play hamlet for the stage in moscow directed the opera boris godunov in london and he directed radio production of the short story turnabout by william faulkner he also wrote sculpting in time book on film theory tarkovsky first feature film was ivan childhood in he then directed andrei rublev in solaris in mirror in and stalker in the documentary voyage in time was produced in italy in as was nostalghia in his last film the sacrifice was produced in sweden in tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films sometimes with cowriter tarkovsky once said that

sir john tenniel illustration of the caterpillar for lewis carroll alice adventures in wonderland is noted for its ambiguous central figure whose head can be viewed as being human male face with pointed nose and chin or as being the head end of an actual caterpillar with the first two right true legs visible ambiguity is type of meaning in which phrase statement or resolution is not explicitly defined making several interpretations plausible common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty it is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to rule or process with finite number of steps the ambi part of the term reflects an idea of two as in two meanings the concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness in ambiguity specific and distinct interpretations are permitted although some may not be immediately obvious whereas with information that is vague it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity context may play role in resolving ambiguity for example the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another linguistic forms lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity the former represents choice between finite number of known and meaningful context dependent interpretations the latter represents choice between any number of possible interpretations none of which may have standard agreed upon meaning this form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness linguistic ambiguity can be problem in law because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence pepe vio pablo enfurecido interpretation when pepe was angry then he saw pepe saw that pablo was angry here the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation lexical ambiguity the lexical ambiguity of word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs meaning here refers to whatever should be captured by good dictionary for instance the word bank has several distinct lexical definitions including financial institution and edge of river or consider apothecary one could say bought herbs from the apothecary this could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary pharmacist or went to the apothecary pharmacy the context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended if for instance someone says buried in the bank most people would not think someone used shovel to dig in the mud however some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate used word lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with word in context task referred to as word sense disambiguation the use of multi defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning in which case less ambiguous term should have been used the goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver have no about what was meant to be conveyed an exception to this could include politician whose weasel words and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice ambiguity is powerful tool of political science more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts good for example can mean useful or functional that good hammer exemplary she good student pleasing this is good soup moral good person versus the lesson to be learned from story righteous etc have good daughter is not clear about which sense is intended the various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity unlockable can mean capable of being unlocked or impossible to lock ambiguity is an effective narrative device to engage hearer in conversation and to move it to level of deeper import in the gospel of john jesus uses an ambiguous metaphor or double entendre to create bewilderment or in the hearer which is then resolved either by jesus or the narrator the new testament exegete rudolf bultmann explains the way ambiguity functions in the fourth gospel the comes when someone sees the right meaning of the word but mistakenly imagines that its meaning is exhausted by earthly matters case in point is the ambiguous metaphor of living water greek ὕδωρ ζῶν hydōr zōn in john woman from samaria assumes that jesus knows of flowing stream living water that will make her job of fetching water at jacob well in sychar easier jesus however has in mind different type of living water one that wells up within person in the figurative or spiritual sense of the word semantic and syntactic ambiguity semantic ambiguity occurs when word phrase or sentence taken out of context has more than one interpretation in we saw her duck example due to richard nordquist the words her duck can refer either to the person bird the noun duck modified by the possessive pronoun her or to motion she made the verb duck the subject of which is the objective pronoun her object of the verb saw syntactic ambiguity arises when sentence can have two or more different meanings because of the structure of the sentence its syntax this is often due to modifying expression such as prepositional phrase the application of which is unclear he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies to get in you will need an entrance fee of or your voucher and your drivers license this could mean that you need either ten dollars or both your voucher and your license or it could mean that you need your license and you need either ten dollars or voucher only rewriting the sentence or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve syntactic ambiguity for the notion of and theoretic results about syntactic ambiguity in artificial formal languages such as computer programming languages see ambiguous grammar usually semantic and syntactic ambiguity go hand in hand the sentence we saw her duck is also syntactically ambiguous conversely sentence like he ate the cookies on the couch is also semantically ambiguous rarely but occasionally the different parsings of syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning for example the command cook cook can be parsed as cook noun used as vocative cook imperative verb form but also as cook imperative verb form cook noun used as vocative it is more common that syntactically unambiguous phrase has semantic ambiguity for example the lexical ambiguity in your boss is funny man is purely semantic leading to the response funny ha ha or funny peculiar spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities where there is more than one way to compose set of sounds into words for example ice cream and scream such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context mishearing of such based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity is called mondegreen metonymy involves referring to one entity by the name of different but closely related entity for example using wheels to refer to car or wall street to refer to the stock exchanges located on that street or even the entire us financial sector in the modern vocabulary of critical semiotics metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity located close together or function or process that an object performs such as sweet ride to refer to nice car metonym is considered primary mechanism of linguistic humor philosophy philosophers and other users of logic spend lot of time and effort searching for and removing or intentionally adding ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments for example politician might say oppose taxes which hinder economic growth an example of glittering generality some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth in writing the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible either by adding comma after taxes to convey the first sense or by changing which to that to convey the second sense or by rewriting it in other ways the devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way and think the politician supports everyone opinion however the opposite can also be true an opponent can turn positive statement into bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity intentionally or not the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases in continental philosophy particularly phenomenology and existentialism there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition martin heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous as is the relation of mind and body and part and whole in heidegger phenomenology dasein is always in meaningful world but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification thus although some things may be certain they have little to do with dasein sense of care and existential anxiety in the face of death in calling his work being and nothingness an essay in ontology jean paul sartre follows heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity simone de beauvoir tries to base an ethics on heidegger and sartre writings the ethics of ambiguity where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity as long as philosophers and they men have thought most of them have tried to mask it and the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal it has been matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science she states since we do not succeed in fleeing it let us therefore try to look the truth in the face let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity it is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life nature and sex are ambiguous corey anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else language he asserts divides what is not in fact separate following ernest becker he argues that the desire to authoritatively disambiguate the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide on this basis he argues that ethics must focus on dialectically integrating opposites and balancing tension rather than seeking priori validation or certainty like the existentialists and he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity literature and rhetoric in literature and rhetoric ambiguity can be useful tool groucho marx classic joke depends on grammatical ambiguity for its humor for example last night shot an elephant in my pajamas how he got in my pajamas ll never know songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect as in the song title don it make my brown eyes blue where blue can refer to the color or to sadness in the narrative ambiguity can be introduced in several ways motive plot character scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby mathematical notation mathematical notation widely used in physics and other sciences avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language however for various reasons several lexical syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain names of functions the ambiguity in the style of writing function should not be confused with multivalued function which can and should be defined in deterministic and unambiguous way several special functions still do not have established notations usually the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value sometimes the same name of the function is used causing confusions examples of such functions sinc function elliptic integral of the third kind translating elliptic integral form maple to mathematica one should replace the second argument to its square see talk elliptic integral list of notations dealing with complex values this may cause problems exponential integral hermite polynomial expressions ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts it is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions also it is common to give the same name to variable and function for example then if one sees there is no way to distinguish whether it means multiplied by or function evaluated at argument equal to in each case of use of such notations the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities many algorithmic languages and fortran require the character as symbol of multiplication the wolfram language used in mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of function square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions fortran in addition does not allow use of the same name identifier for different objects for example function and variable in particular the expression is qualified as an error the order of operations may depend on the context in most programming languages the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right until the last century many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first for example is interpreted as in this case the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language in addition it is common to write an argument of function without parenthesis which also may lead to ambiguity in the scientific journal style one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions whereas variables are written using italics for example in mathematical journals the expression does not denote the sine function but the product of the three variables although in the informal notation of slide presentation it may stand for commas in multi component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted this is also potentially ambiguous notation for example in the notation the reader can only infer from the context whether it means single index object taken with the subscript equal to product of variables and or it is an indication to trivalent tensor examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions an expression such as can be understood to mean either or often the author intention can be understood from the context in cases where only one of the two makes sense but an ambiguity like this should be avoided for example by writing or the expression means in several texts though it might be thought to mean since commonly means conversely might seem to mean as this exponentiation notation usually denotes function iteration in general means however for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions this notation conventionally means exponentiation of the result of function application the expression can be interpreted as meaning in particular if one thinks that the common acronym pemdas for the order of operations implies that ultiplication takes precedence over ivision however it is more commonly understood to mean notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics it is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with and states with fixed number of photons with then there is an unwritten rule the state is coherent if there are more greek characters than latin characters in the argument and photon state if the latin characters dominate the ambiguity becomes even worse if is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate and means the state with certain value of the momentum which may be used in books on quantum mechanics such ambiguities easily lead to confusions especially if some normalized adimensional dimensionless variables are used expression may mean state with single photon or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to or state with momentum equal to unity and so on the reader is supposed to guess from the context ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics some physical quantities do not yet have established notations their value and sometimes even dimension as in the case of the einstein coefficients depends on the system of notations many terms are ambiguous each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition suitable for specific case just like ludwig wittgenstein states in tractatus logico philosophicus only in the context of proposition has name meaning highly confusing term is gain for example the sentence the gain of system should be doubled without context means close to nothing it may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled it may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled it may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled for example doubling the population of the upper laser level in quasi two level system assuming negligible absorption of the ground state the term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light the term can refer to any of irradiance luminous intensity radiant intensity or radiance depending on the background of the person using the term also confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of dopant or resolution of an imaging system as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise see also accuracy and precision and its talk the berry paradox arises as result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as definable or nameable terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies other terms with this type of ambiguity are satisfiable true false function property class relation cardinal and ordinal mathematical interpretation of ambiguity the necker cube and impossible cube an underdetermined and overdetermined object respectively thumb in mathematics and logic ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of for example leaves open what the value of is while its opposite is self contradiction also called inconsistency paradoxicalness or oxymoron or in mathematics an inconsistent system such as which has no solution logical ambiguity and self contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects such as the necker cube and impossible cube or many of the drawings of escher constructed language some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity especially lexical ambiguity lojban and loglan are two related languages which have been created for this focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well the languages can be both spoken and written these languages are intended to provide greater technical precision over big natural languages although historically such attempts at language improvement have been criticized languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency the many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time consuming and difficult to learn biology in structural biology ambiguity has been recognized as problem for studying protein conformations the analysis of protein three dimensional structure consists in dividing the macromolecule into subunits called domains the difficulty of this task arises from the fact that different definitions of what domain is can be used folding autonomy function thermodynamic stability or domain motions which sometimes results in single protein having different yet equally valid domain assignments christianity and judaism christianity and judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with ambiguity many christians and jews endorse rudolf otto description of the sacred as mysterium tremendum et fascinans the awe inspiring mystery which fascinates humans the orthodox catholic writer chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases the title of one of his most famous books orthodoxy itself employing such paradox music in music pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous such as some polytonality polymeter other ambiguous meters or rhythms and ambiguous phrasing or stein any aspect of music the music of africa is often purposely ambiguous to quote sir donald francis tovey theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has high aesthetic value visual art ambiguous image that can be interpreted in three

particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices dram addressed directly by binary machine register where decimal interpretation makes no practical sense subsequently the ki mi and gi prefixes

skeleton of an aardvark the aardvark orycteropus afer is medium sized burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa it is the only living species of the order tubulidentata although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known unlike other insectivores it has long pig like snout which is used to sniff out food it roams over most of the southern two thirds of the african continent avoiding areas that are mainly rocky nocturnal feeder it subsists on ants and termites which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs it also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young it receives least concern rating from the iucn although its numbers seem to be decreasing aardvarks are afrotheres clade which also includes elephants manatees and hyraxes name and taxonomy name the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called the african ant bear anteater not to be confused with the south american anteater or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope the name aardvark is afrikaans comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig aarde earth ground vark pig because of its burrowing habits the name orycteropus means burrowing foot and the name afer refers to africa the name of the aardvarks order tubulidentata comes from the tubule style teeth taxonomy the skull of an aardvark the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristics and superficial resemblance the similarities are based on convergent evolution the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews tenrecs and golden moles along with the sirenians hyraxes elephants and their extinct relatives these animals form the superorder afrotheria studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra and given the clade status as wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as condylarths are actually stem aardvarks evolutionary history based on fossils bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene the ptolemaiidans mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities may actually be stem aardvarks either as sister clade to tubulidentata or as grade leading to true tubulidentates the first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits the earliest example from the genus orycteropus was orycteropus mauritanicus found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene with an equally old version found in kenya fossils from the aardvark have been dated to million years and have been located throughout europe and the near east the mysterious pleistocene from madagascar was originally thought to be tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene however number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that is relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution subspecies the aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed orycteropus afer afer adametzi grote aethiopicus sundevall angolensis zukowsky haltenorth

wardi lydekker wertheri matschie the encyclopædia britannica also mentions capensis or cape ant bear from south africa description an aardvark skeleton and mounted individual the aardvark is vaguely pig like in appearance its body is stout with prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs the limbs are of moderate length with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes while the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel like and appears to be intermediate between claw and hoof whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade it appears at time to be plantigrade this confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone cccb the stress and strain resistance provided by cccb allows aardvarks to create their burrows ultimately leading to favorable environment for plants and variety of animals an aardvark weight is typically between an aardvark length is usually between and can reach lengths of when its tail which can be up to is taken into account it is tall at the shoulder and has girth of about it is the largest member of the proposed clade the aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color and often stained reddish brown by soil the aardvark coat is thin and the animal primary protection is its tough skin its hair is short on its head and tail however its legs tend to have longer hair the hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of hairs the hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers head the greatly elongated head is set on short thick neck and the end of the snout bears disc which houses the nostrils it contains thin but complete zygomatic arch the head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is their teeth instead of having pulp cavity each tooth has cluster of thin hexagonal upright parallel tubes of vasodentin modified form of dentine with individual pulp canals held together by cementum the number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth with the largest having about the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously the aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw which fall out and are not replaced adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw and have dental formula of these remaining teeth are peg like and rootless and are of unique composition the teeth consist of upper and lower jaw molars the nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area as it contains ten nasal conchae more than any other placental mammal the sides of the nostrils are thick with hair the tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscles the fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any other mammal with between and compared to dogs with to with large quantity of turbinate bones the aardvark has more space for the moist epithelium which is the location of the olfactory bulb the nose contains nine olfactory bulbs more than any other mammal its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain as its olfactory lobe is very developed the snout resembles an elongated pig snout the mouth is small and tubular typical of species that feed on ants and termites the aardvark has long thin snakelike protruding tongue as much as long and elaborate structures supporting keen sense of smell the ears which are very effective are long about long the eyes are small for its head and consist only of rods digestive system the aardvark stomach has muscular pyloric area that acts as gizzard to grind swallowed food up thereby rendering chewing unnecessary its cecum is large both sexes emit strong smelling secretion from an anal gland its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness the female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region genetically speaking the aardvark is living fossil as its chromosomes are highly conserved reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa habitat and range aardvarks are found in sub saharan africa where suitable habitat savannas grasslands woodlands and bushland and food ants and termites is available they spend the daylight hours in dark burrows to avoid the heat of the day the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest as the high water table precludes digging to sufficient depth they also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging they have been documented as high as in ethiopia they are present throughout sub saharan africa all the way to south africa with few exceptions these exceptions include the coastal areas of namibia ivory coast and ghana they are not found in madagascar ecology and behaviour aardvark resting entrance to burrow emerging from burrow aardvarks live for up to years in captivity its keen hearing warns it of predators lions leopards cheetahs african wild dogs hyenas and pythons some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies but if all else fails they will strike with their claws tail and shoulders sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker they will also dig to escape as they can when pressed dig extremely quickly feeding the aardvark is nocturnal and is solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites myrmecophagy the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber in fact the cucumber and the aardvark have symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit then defecate the seeds near their burrows which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area the time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark they avoid eating the african driver ant and red ants due to their stringent diet requirements they require large range to survive an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over considerable home range encompassing while foraging for food the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food they zig zag as they forage and will usually not repeat route for days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again during foraging period they will stop and dig shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as means to explore their location when concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongue as many as in one night have been recorded its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of termite or ant mound quickly it avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils when successful the aardvark long up to tongue licks up the insects the termites biting or the ants stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin after an aardvark visit at termite mound other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers termite mounds alone don provide enough food for the aardvark so they look for termites that are on the move when these insects move they can form columns long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark these columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals the trampled grass and dung attract termites from the odontotermes microtermes and genera on nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of night roughly the four hours between and however they don seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems they cover between per night however some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as in night vocalization the aardvark is rather quiet animal however it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance it makes bleating sound if frightened when it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows if one is not close it will dig new one rapidly this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear movement the aardvark is known to be good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents it can dig yard of tunnel in about five minutes but otherwise moves fairly slowly when leaving the burrow at night they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes sniffing and listening after this period of watchfulness it will bound out and within seconds it will be away it will then pause prick its ears twisting its head to listen then jump and move off to start foraging aside from digging out ants and termites the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live which generally fall into one of three categories burrows made while foraging refuge and resting location and permanent homes temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges while the main burrow is also used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and can be as long as these burrows can be large enough for man to enter the aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and periodically moves on and makes new one the old burrows are an important part of the african wildlife scene as they are vacated then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the african wild dog ant eating chat nycteris thebaica and warthogs other animals that use them are hares mongooses hyenas owls pythons and lizards without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season only mothers and young share burrows however the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as solitary creature if attacked in the tunnel it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back and attack with its claws the aardvark has been known to sleep in recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection from its predators reproduction aardvark mother and young aardvarks pair only during the breeding season after gestation period of seven months one cub weighing around is born during may july when born the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles when nursing it will nurse off each teat in succession after two weeks the folds of skin disappear and after three the ears can be held upright after weeks body hair starts growing it is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at weeks and is weaned between three months and weeks at six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age conservation aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers however this is possibly because they are not readily seen there are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits however their numbers seem to be stable overall they are not considered common anywhere in africa but due to their large range they maintain sufficient numbers there may be slight decrease in numbers in eastern northern and western africa southern african numbers are not decreasing it receives an official designation from the iucn as least concern however they are species in precarious situation as they are so dependent on such specific food therefore if problem arises with the abundance of termites the species as whole would be affected drastically aardvarks handle captivity well the first zoo to have one was london zoo in which had an animal from south africa mythology and popular culture tomcat from vf aardvarks with the squadron mascot painted on the tail in african folklore the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants hausa magicians make charm from the heart skin forehead and nails of the aardvark which they then proceed to pound together with the root of certain tree wrapped in piece of skin and worn on the chest the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night the charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents permission also some tribes such as the margbetu ayanda and logo will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets which are regarded as good luck charms the meat which has resemblance to pork is eaten in certain cultures the egyptian god set is usually depicted with the head of an unidentified animal whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship the titular character of arthur an animated television series for children

the aardwolf proteles cristata is an insectivorous mammal native to east and southern africa its name means earth wolf in afrikaans and dutch it is also called maanhaar jackal afrikaans for mane jackal gīb by the nama people ant hyena termite eating hyena and civet hyena based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland characteristic shared with the african civet the aardwolf is in the same family as the hyena unlike many of its relatives in the order carnivora the aardwolf does not hunt large animals it eats insects and their larvae mainly termites one aardwolf can lap up as many as termites during single night using its long sticky tongue the aardwolves tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites the aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern africa open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs it is nocturnal resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food taxonomy the aardwolf is generally classified with the hyena family hyaenidae though it was formerly placed in its own family protelidae early on scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena which subsequently led to the creation of protelidae recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably diverged from other hyaenids early on how early is still unclear as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by million years the aardwolf is the only surviving species in the subfamily protelinae there is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic or can be divided into subspecies cristatus of southern africa and septentrionalis of east africa etymology the generic name proteles comes from two words both of greek origin protos and teleos which combined means complete in front based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear the specific name cristatus comes from latin and means provided with comb relating to their mane physical characteristics detail of head taken at the cincinnati zoo skeleton of an aardwolf displayed at museum of osteology the aardwolf resembles very thin striped hyena but with more slender muzzle black vertical stripes on coat of yellowish fur and long distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back it also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore and hind quarters along with several stripes on its legs the mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger it is missing the throat spot that others in the family have its lower leg from the knee down is all black and its tail is bushy with black tip aardwolf skull the aardwolf is about long excluding its bushy tail which is about long and stands about tall at the shoulders an adult aardwolf weighs approximately sometimes reaching the aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller about than the eastern version around this makes the aardwolf the smallest extant member of the hyaenidae family the front feet have five toes each unlike the four toed hyena the teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas though smaller and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects it does still have canines but unlike other hyenas these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense its ears which are large are very similar to those of the striped hyena as an aardwolf ages it will normally lose some of its teeth though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats distribution and habitat aardwolves live in open dry plains and bushland avoiding mountainous areas due to their specific food requirements they are only found in regions where termites of the family hodotermitidae occur termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs including farmland for most of the year aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to dozen dens which are occupied for six weeks at time there are two distinct populations one in southern africa and another in east and northeast africa the species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests an adult pair along with their most recent offspring occupies territory of behavior san antonio zoo aardwolves are shy and nocturnal sleeping in burrows by day they will on occasion during the winter become diurnal feeders this happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat they have often been mistaken for solitary animals in fact they live as monogamous pairs with their young if their territory is infringed upon they will chase the intruder up to or to the border if the intruder is caught which rarely happens fight will occur which is accompanied by soft clucking hoarse barking and type of roar the majority of incursions occur during mating season when they can occur once or twice per week when food is scarce the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy single territory the territory is marked by both sexes as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in long streaks aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad they often mark near termite mounds within their territory every minutes or so if they are patrolling their territorial boundaries the marking frequency increases drastically to once every at this rate an individual may mark marks per hour and upwards of per night an aardwolf pair may have up to dens and numerous feces middens within their territory when they deposit excreta at their middens they dig small hole and cover it with sand their dens are usually abandoned aardvark springhare or porcupine dens or on occasion they are crevices in rocks they will also dig their own dens or enlarge dens started by springhares they typically will only use one or two dens at time rotating through all of their dens every six months during the summer they may rest outside their den during the night and sleep underground during the heat of the day aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators therefore when threatened the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks if confronted it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing it also emits foul smelling liquid from its anal glands feeding the aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on trinervitermes this genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf range in east africa they eat trinervitermes bettonianus in central africa they eat trinervitermes rhodesiensis and in southern africa they eat trinervoides their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark which digs into the mound they locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites an aardwolf may consume up to termites per night using its long sticky tongue they do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide continuous supply of food they often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months during certain seasonal events such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter the primary termites become scarce so the need for other foods becomes pronounced during these times the southern aardwolf will seek out hodotermes mossambicus type of harvester termite active in the afternoon which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter the eastern aardwolf during the rainy season subsists on termites from the genera odontotermes and macrotermes they are also known to feed on other insects larvae eggs and some sources say occasionally small mammals and birds but these constitute very small percentage of their total diet unlike other hyenas aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals contrary to popular myths aardwolves do not eat carrion and if they are seen eating while hunched over dead carcass they are actually eating larvae and beetles also contrary to some sources they do not like meat unless it is finely ground or cooked for them the adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey their primary source trinervitermes forages in small but dense patches of while foraging the aardwolf can cover about per hour which translates to per summer night and per winter night breeding the breeding season varies depending on location but normally takes place during autumn or spring in south africa breeding occurs in early july during the breeding season unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory as well as others for female to mate with dominant males also mate with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves which can result in conflict between rival males dominant males even go step further and as the breeding season approaches they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males territories as the female comes into oestrus they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories sometimes doing so more in rivals territories than their own females will also when given the opportunity mate with the dominant male which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding his cubs with her copulation lasts between and hours gestation lasts between and days producing two to five cubs most often two or three during the rainy season november december when termites are more active they are born with their eyes open but initially are helpless and weigh around the first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents the male may spend up to six hours night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food after three months they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent though they often share den with their mother until the next breeding season by the time the next set of cubs is born the older cubs have moved on aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and half to two years of age conservation the aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and is relatively widespread throughout eastern africa they are not common throughout their range as they maintain density of no more than per square kilometer if food is abundant because of these factors the iucn has rated the aardwolf as least concern in some areas they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock however they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental in other areas the farmers have recognized this but they are still killed on occasion for their fur dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the

adobe wall detail in bahillo palencia spain renewal of the surface coating of an adobe wall in chamisal new mexico shiraz iran its urban gardens are separated by adobe walls adobe is building material made from earth and organic materials is spanish for mudbrick but in some english speaking regions of spanish heritage the term is used to refer to any kind of earthen construction most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to cob and rammed earth buildings adobe is among the earliest building materials and is used throughout the world description adobe bricks are rectangular prisms small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking they can be subsequently assembled with the application of adobe mud to bond the individual bricks into structure there is no standard size with substantial variations over the years and in different regions in some areas popular size measured weighing about in other contexts the size is weighing about the maximum sizes can reach up to above this weight it becomes difficult to move the pieces and it is preferred to ram the mud in situ resulting in different typology known as rammed earth strength in dry climates adobe structures are extremely durable and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not reinforced cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the guatemala earthquake the bam earthquake and the chile earthquake distribution buildings made of sun dried earth are common throughout the world middle east western asia north africa west africa south america southwestern north america spain and eastern europe adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the americas in the southwestern united states mesoamerica and the andes for several thousand years puebloan peoples built their adobe structures with handsful or basketsful of adobe until the spanish introduced them to making bricks adobe bricks were used in spain from the late bronze and iron ages eighth century bce onwards its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture and economics distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks and the larger adobines some of which may be one to two yards long etymology church at san pedro de atacama chile the word adobe has existed for around years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning the word can be traced from the middle egyptian bc word ɟbt mud brick middle egyptian evolved into late egyptian demotic or pre coptic and finally to coptic bc where it appeared as τωωβε this was adopted into arabic as aṭ ṭawbu or aṭ ṭūbu with the definite article al attached tuba this was assimilated into the old spanish language as adobe probably via mozarabic english borrowed the word from spanish in the early th century still referring to mudbrick construction in more modern english usage the term adobe has come to include style of architecture popular in the desert climates of north america especially in new mexico regardless of the construction method composition adobe style in santa fe new mexico an adobe brick is composite material made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung the soil composition typically contains sand silt and clay straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick dung offers the same advantage the most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is clay silt and fine sand another source quotes clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles with no deleterious effect modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or portland cement up to by weight no more than half the clay content should be expansive clays with the remainder non expansive illite or kaolinite too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick resulting in cracking while too much kaolinite will make weak brick typically the soils of the southwest united states where such construction has been widely used are an adequate composition material properties the great mosque of djenné mali is built in adobe the struts projecting from the wall serve as decoration as well as supports for scaffolding during maintenance adobe walls are load bearing they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength in the united states most building codes call for minimum compressive strength of lbf in newton mm for the adobe block adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads the building codes require the building sustain lateral acceleration earthquake load such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses to withstand such loads the codes typically call for tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least lbf in newton mm for the finished block in addition to being an inexpensive material with small resource cost adobe can serve as significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction in climates typified by hot days and cool nights the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day moderating the temperature of the living space the massive walls require large and relatively long input of heat from the sun radiation and from the surrounding air convection before they warm through to the interior after the sun sets and the temperature drops the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time lag effect thus well planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates factor which has contributed to its longevity as building material thermodynamic material properties have significant variation in the literature some experiments suggest that the standard consideration of conductivity is not adequate for this material as its main thermodynamic property is inertia and conclude that experimental tests should be performed over longer period of time than usual preferably with changing thermal jumps there is an effective value for north facing in wall of hr ft btu which corresponds to thermal conductivity in ft in btu hr ft or in agreement with the thermal conductivity reported from another source to determine the total value of wall scale by the thickness of the wall in inches the thermal resistance of adobe is also stated as an value for inch wall hr ft btu another source provides the following properties conductivity btu hr ft or specific heat capacity btu lb or kj kg and density lb ft or kg giving heat capacity btu ft or kj using the average value of the thermal conductivity as btu hr ft or the thermal diffusivity is calculated to be ft or uses poured and puddled adobe walls cliff dwellings of poured or puddled adobe cob at cuarenta casas in mexico poured and puddled adobe puddled clay piled earth today called cob is made by placing soft adobe in layers rather than by making individual dried bricks or using form puddle is general term for clay or clay and sand based material worked into dense plastic state these are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the spanish adobe bricks adobe bricks near construction site in milyanfan kyrgyzstan bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame in north america the brick is typically about in size the mixture is molded into the frame which is removed after initial setting after drying for few hours the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying slow drying in shade reduces cracking the same mixture without straw is used to make mortar and often plaster on interior and exterior walls some cultures used lime based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks reinforcement can include manure straw cement rebar or wooden posts straw cement or manure added to standard adobe mixture can produce stronger more crack resistant brick test is done on the soil content first to do so sample of the soil is mixed into clear container with some water creating an almost completely saturated liquid the container is shaken vigorously for one minute it is then allowed to settle for day until the soil has settled into layers heavier particles settle out first sand above silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days after the water has cleared percentages of the various particles can be determined fifty to percent sand and to percent clay will yield strong bricks the cooperative state research education and extension service at new mexico state university recommends mix of not more than clay not less than sand and never more than silt adobe wall construction the earthen plaster removed exposing the adobe bricks at fort st sebastian in france the ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall footing depth is to be below the ground frost level the footing and stem wall are commonly and inches thick respectively modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall adobe bricks are laid by course adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength when creating window and door openings lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above atop the last courses of brick bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces to protect the interior and exterior adobe walls finishes such as mud plaster whitewash or stucco can be applied these protect the adobe wall from water damage but need to be reapplied periodically alternatively the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters adobe roof the traditional adobe roof has been constructed using mixture of soil clay water sand and organic materials the mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe depending on the materials available roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create framework to begin layering adobe bricks depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks the framework has been preformed using steel framing and layering of metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly this method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking the more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads the heaviest wooden beams called vigas lie atop the wall across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas and upon those brush is then laid finally the adobe layer is applied to construct flat adobe roof beams of wood were laid to span the building the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls once the vigas latillas and brush are laid adobe bricks are placed an adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof following each individual brick should be layer of adobe mortar recommended to be at least thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick edges and also to provide relative moisture barrier during rain roof design evolved around in the american southwest three inches of adobe mud was applied on top of the latillas then inches of dry adobe dirt applied to the roof the dirt was contoured into low slope to downspout aka canal when moisture was applied to the roof the clay particles expanded to create waterproof membrane once year it was necessary to pull the weeds from the roof and re slope the dirt as needed depending on the materials adobe roofs can be inherently fire proof the construction of chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials the builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in similar fashion as the surrounding walls in the uniform building code ubc was adopted in the united states local ordinances referencing the ubc added requirements to building with adobe these included restriction of building height of adobe structures to story requirements for adobe mix compressive and shear strength and new requirements which stated that every building shall be designed to withstand seismic activity specifically lateral forces by the however seismic related changes in the california building code effectively ended solid wall adobe construction in california however post

an adventure is an exciting experience that is typically bold sometimes risky undertaking adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling exploring skydiving mountain climbing scuba diving river rafting or participating in extreme sports adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in risky manner motivation adventurous experiences create psychological arousal which can be interpreted as negative fear or positive flow for some people adventure becomes major pursuit in and of itself according to adventurer andré malraux in his la condition humaine if man is not ready to risk his life where is his dignity similarly helen keller stated that life is either daring adventure or nothing outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers the british adventurer jason lewis for example uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning author jon levy suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure be remarkable that is worth talking about involve adversity or perceived risk bring about personal growth mythology and fiction some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as homer the odyssey the knight errant was the form the adventure seeker character took in the late middle ages the adventure novel exhibits these protagonist on adventurous journey characteristics as do many popular feature films such as star wars and raiders of the lost ark lewis carroll alice adventures in wonderland is well known example of fantasized adventure story outdoors adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or mother nature examples include books such as hatchet or my side of the mountain these books are less about questing such as in mythology or other adventure novels but more about surviving on their own living off the land gaining new experiences and becoming closer to the natural world questing many adventures are based on the idea of quest the hero goes off in pursuit of reward whether it be skill prize or perhaps the safety of person on the way the hero must overcome various obstacles video games in video game culture an adventure game is video game in which the player assumes the role of protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle solving the genre focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative based media literature and film encompassing wide variety of literary genres many adventure games text and graphic are designed for single player since this emphasis on story and character makes multi player design difficult nonfiction works from ancient times travelers and explorers have written about their adventures journals which became best sellers in their day were written such as marco polo journal the travels of marco polo or mark twain roughing it others were personal journals only later published such as the journals of lewis and clark or captain james cook journals there are also books written by those not directly part of the adventure in question such as the right stuff by tom wolfe or books written by those participating in the adventure but in format other than that of journal such as conquistadors of the useless by lionel terray documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well adventure sports there are many sports classified as adventure games or sports due to their inherent danger and excitement some of these include mountain climbing skydiving or other extreme sports see also list of genres exploration tourism travel sports adventure travel adventure film adventure playground references external links website of the research unit philology of adventure ongoing research project on the literary history of the adventure pattern what is an adventure definition of adventure hero and epic with an illustration of the hero journey wikivoyage martin feeney going on journey life in year
map of the most populous part of asia showing physical political and population characteristics as per asia is earth largest and most populous continent located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres it shares the continental landmass of eurasia with the continent of europe and the continental landmass of afro eurasia with both europe and africa asia covers an area of about of earth total land area and of the earth total surface area the continent which has long been home to the majority of the human population was the site of many of the first civilizations asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions its billion people constitute roughly of the world population in general terms asia is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean the border of asia with europe is historical and cultural construct as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them it is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity the division of eurasia into two continents reflects east west cultural linguistic and ethnic differences some of which vary on spectrum rather than with sharp dividing line the most commonly accepted boundaries place asia to the east of the suez canal separating it from africa and to the east of the turkish straits the ural mountains and ural river and to the south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas separating it from europe china and india alternated in being the largest economies in the world from to ce china was major economic power and attracted many to the east and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of india personified asia attracting european commerce exploration and colonialism the accidental discovery of trans atlantic route from europe to america by columbus while in search for route to india demonstrates this deep fascination the silk road became the main east west trading route in the asian hinterlands while the straits of malacca stood as major sea route asia has exhibited economic dynamism particularly east asia as well as robust population growth during the th century but overall population growth has since fallen asia was the birthplace of most of the world mainstream religions including hinduism zoroastrianism judaism jainism buddhism confucianism taoism christianity islam sikhism as well as many other religions given its size and diversity the concept of asia name dating back to classical antiquity may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups cultures environments economics historical ties and government systems it also has mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the middle east temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in siberia definition and boundaries asia africa boundary the boundary between asia and africa is the red sea the gulf of suez and the suez canal this makes egypt country with the sinai peninsula in asia and the remainder of the country in africa asia europe boundary modern definition mostly fits with the lines and in this image the threefold division of the old world into europe asia and africa has been in use since the th century bc due to greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river the modern rioni river in georgia of caucasus from its mouth by poti on the black sea coast through the surami pass and along the kura river to the caspian sea convention still followed by herodotus in the th century bc during the hellenistic period this convention was revised and the boundary between europe and asia was now considered to be the tanais the modern don river this is the convention used by roman era authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy the border between asia and europe was historically defined by european academics the don river became unsatisfactory to northern europeans when peter the great king of the tsardom of russia defeating rival claims of sweden and the ottoman empire to the eastern lands and armed resistance by the tribes of siberia synthesized new russian empire extending to the ural mountains and beyond founded in the major geographical theorist of the empire was former swedish prisoner of war taken at the battle of poltava in and assigned to tobolsk where he associated with peter siberian official vasily tatishchev and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for future book in sweden five years after peter death in philip johan von strahlenberg published new atlas proposing the ural mountains as the border of asia tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von strahlenberg the latter had suggested the emba river as the lower boundary over the next century various proposals were made until the ural river prevailed in the mid th century the border had been moved perforce from the black sea to the caspian sea into which the ural river projects the border between the black sea and the caspian is usually placed along the crest of the caucasus mountains although it is sometimes placed further north asia oceania boundary the border between asia and the region of oceania is usually placed somewhere in the malay archipelago the maluku islands in indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast asia with new guinea to the east of the islands being wholly part of oceania the terms southeast asia and oceania devised in the th century have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception the chief factor in determining which islands of the malay archipelago are asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there not all european lewis and wigen assert the narrowing of southeast asia to its present boundaries was thus gradual process ongoing definition afro eurasia shown in green geographical asia is cultural artifact of european conceptions of the world beginning with the ancient greeks being imposed onto other cultures an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents from the time of herodotus minority of geographers have rejected the three continent system europe africa asia on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them for example sir barry cunliffe the emeritus professor of european archeology at oxford argues that europe has been geographically and culturally merely the western excrescence of the continent of asia geographically asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of eurasia with europe being northwestern peninsula of the landmass asia europe and africa make up single continuous landmass afro eurasia except for the suez canal and share common continental shelf almost all of europe and the better part of asia sit atop the eurasian plate adjoined on the south by the arabian and indian plate and with the easternmost part of siberia east of the chersky range on the north american plate etymology ptolemy asia the idea of place called asia was originally concept of greek civilization though this might not correspond to the entire continent currently known by that name the english word comes from latin literature where it has the same form asia whether asia in other languages comes from latin of the roman empire is much less certain and the ultimate source of the latin word is uncertain though several theories have been published one of the first classical writers to use asia as name of the whole continent was pliny this metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names such as scandinavia from scania bronze age before greek poetry the aegean sea area was in greek dark age at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun prior to then in the bronze age the records of the assyrian empire the hittite empire and the various mycenaean states of greece mention region undoubtedly asia certainly in anatolia including if not identical to lydia these records are administrative and do not include poetry the mycenaean states were destroyed about bce by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the dorian invasion to this time the burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in greek syllabic script called linear deciphered by number of interested parties most notably by young world war ii cryptographer michael ventris subsequently assisted by the scholar john chadwick major cache discovered by carl blegen at the site of ancient pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods some of these are of women held in servitude as study of the society implied by the content reveals they were used in trades such as cloth making and usually came with children the epithet lawiaiai captives associated with some of them identifies their origin some are ethnic names one in particular aswiai identifies women of asia perhaps they were captured in asia but some others milatiai appear to have been of miletus greek colony which would not have been raided for slaves by greeks chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased the name is also in the singular aswia which refers both to the name of country and to female from there there is masculine form this aswia appears to have been remnant of region known to the hittites as assuwa centered on lydia or roman asia this name assuwa has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent asia the assuwa league was confederation of states in western anatolia defeated by the hittites under tudhaliya around bce alternatively the etymology of the term may be from the akkadian word which means to go outside or to ascend referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the middle east and also likely connected with the phoenician word asa meaning east this may be contrasted to similar etymology proposed for europe as being from akkadian to enter or set of the sun reid supports this alternative etymology noting that the ancient greek name must have derived from asu meaning east in assyrian ereb for europe meaning west the ideas of occidental form latin occidens setting and oriental from latin oriens for rising are also european invention synonymous with western and eastern reid further emphasizes that it explains the western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of asia into single classification almost as if there were need for setting the distinction between western and eastern civilizations on the eurasian continent kazuo ogura and tenshin okakura are two outspoken japanese figures on the subject classical antiquity asia highlighted in red within the roman empire latin asia and greek ἀσία appear to be the same word roman authors translated ἀσία as asia the romans named province asia located in western anatolia in modern day turkey there was an asia minor and an asia major located in modern day iraq as the earliest evidence of the name is greek it is likely that asia came from ἀσία but ancient transitions due to the lack of literary contexts are difficult to catch in the act the most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians such as herodotus who were all greek ancient greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name the first continental use of asia is attributed to herodotus about bce not because he innovated it but because his histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail he defines it carefully mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read but whose works are now missing by it he means anatolia and the persian empire in contrast to greece and egypt herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women names were given to tract which is in reality one europa asia and libya referring to africa stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus hesione but that the lydians say it was named after asies son of cotys who passed the name on to tribe at sardis in greek mythology asia ἀσία or asie ἀσίη was the name of nymph or titan goddess of lydia in ancient greek religion places were under the care of female divinities parallel to guardian angels the poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical greek drama and became greek mythology for example hesiod mentions the daughters of tethys and ocean among whom are holy company who with the lord apollo and the rivers have youths in their keeping many of these are geographic doris rhodea europa asia hesiod explains the iliad attributed by the ancient greeks to homer mentions two phrygians the tribe that replaced the luvians in lydia in the trojan war named asios an adjective meaning asian and also marsh or lowland containing marsh in lydia as according to many muslims the term came from ancient egypt queen asiya the adoptive mother of moses history the silk road connected civilizations across asia the mongol empire at its greatest extent the gray area is the later timurid empire the history of asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions east asia south asia southeast asia and the middle east linked by the interior mass of the central asian steppes the coastal periphery was home to some of the world earliest known civilizations each of them developing around fertile river valleys the civilizations in mesopotamia the indus valley and the yellow river shared many similarities these civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel other innovations such as writing seem to have been developed individually in each area cities states and empires developed in these lowlands the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse mounted nomads who could reach all areas of asia from the steppes the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indo europeans who spread their languages into the middle east south asia and the borders of china where the tocharians resided the northernmost part of asia including much of siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests climate and tundra these areas remained very sparsely populated the center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty while the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially in many cases they could do little in military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe however the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support large horsebound force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in china india and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies the islamic caliphate defeats of the byzantine and persian empires led to west asia and southern parts of central asia and western parts of south asia under its control during its conquests of the th century the mongol empire conquered large part of asia in the th century an area extending from china to europe before the mongol invasion song dynasty reportedly had approximately million citizens the census which followed the invasion reported roughly million people the black death one of the most devastating pandemics in human history is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia where it then travelled along the silk road the russian empire began to expand into asia from the th century and would eventually take control of all of siberia and most of central asia by the end of the th century the ottoman empire controlled anatolia most of the middle east north africa and the balkans from the mid th century onwards in the th century the manchu conquered china and established the qing dynasty the islamic mughal empire and the hindu maratha empire controlled much of india in the th and th centuries respectively the empire of japan controlled most of east

their origins in asia including the five most practiced in the world excluding irreligion which are christianity islam hinduism chinese folk religion classified as confucianism and taoism and buddhism respectively asian mythology is complex and diverse the story of the great flood for example as presented to jews in the hebrew bible in the narrative of noah and later to christians in the old testament and to muslims in the quran is earliest found in mesopotamian mythology in the enûma eliš and epic of gilgamesh hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of vishnu in the form of fish who warned manu of terrible flood ancient chinese mythology also tells of great flood spanning generations one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control abrahamic the western wall and the dome of the rock jerusalem pilgrims in the annual hajj at the kaabah in mecca the abrahamic religions including judaism christianity islam and baháʼí faith originated in west asia judaism the oldest of the abrahamic faiths is practiced primarily in israel the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the hebrew nation which today consists both of those jews who remained

is south of the typical latitudes of hurricanes but was affected by two in their early stages in late etymology there are different theories as to the origin of the name aruba from the spanish oro hubo which means there was gold from the island carib word oruba which means well placed from the island carib words ora shell and oubao island history pre colonial era arawak petroglyphs in the ayo rocks there has been human presence on aruba from as early as circa bc the first identifiable group are the arawak caquetío amerindians who migrated from south america about ad archaeological evidence suggests continuing links between these native arubans and amerindian peoples of mainland south america arrival of europeans and spanish period the first europeans to visit aruba were amerigo vespucci and alonso de ojeda in who claimed the island for spain both men described aruba as an island of giants remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native caquetíos vespucci returned to spain with stocks of cotton and brazilwood from the island and described houses built into the ocean vespucci and ojeda tales spurred interest in aruba and the spanish began colonising the island alonso de ojeda was appointed the island first governor in from the spanish began enslaving the caquetíos sending many to life of forced labour in the mines of hispaniola the island low rainfall and arid landscape meant that it was not considered profitable for slave based plantation system and the type of large scale slavery so common on other caribbean islands never became established on aruba early dutch period remains of gold mine at bushiribana the netherlands seized aruba from spain in in the course of the thirty years war peter stuyvesant later appointed to new amsterdam new york was the first dutch governor those arawak who had survived the depredations of the spanish were allowed to farm and graze livestock with the dutch using the island as source of meat for their other possessions in the caribbean aruba proximity to south america resulted in interactions with the cultures of the coastal areas for example architectural similarities can be seen between the th century parts of oranjestad and the nearby venezuelan city of coro in falcón state historically dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration its use increased in the late th and early th centuries students on curaçao aruba and bonaire were taught predominantly in spanish until the late th century during the napoleonic wars the british empire took control of the island occupying it between and before handing it back to the dutch as per the terms of the anglo dutch treaty of aruba subsequently became part of the colony of curaçao and dependencies along with bonaire during the th century an economy based on gold mining phosphate production and aloe vera plantations developed however the island remained relatively poor backwater th and st centuries the first oil refinery in aruba was built in by royal dutch shell the facility was built just to the west of the capital city oranjestad and was commonly called the eagle immediately following this another refinery was built by lago oil and transport company in an area now known as san nicolas on the east end of aruba these refineries processed crude oil from the vast venezuelan oil fields bringing greater prosperity to the island the refinery on aruba grew to become one of the largest in the world during world war ii the netherlands was occupied by nazi germany in the oil facilities in aruba came under the administration of the dutch government in exile in london causing them to be attacked by the german navy in in august aruba presented its first staatsreglement constitution for aruba status aparte as an autonomous state within the kingdom of the netherlands prompted by the efforts of henny eman noted aruban politician by the charter of the kingdom of the netherlands was established providing framework for relations between aruba and the rest of the kingdom this created the netherlands antilles which united all of the dutch colonies in the caribbean into one administrative structure many

dutch guiana betico croes politician from aruba proposed the creation of dutch commonwealth of four states aruba the netherlands suriname and the netherlands antilles each to have its own nationality

with the creation of flag and national anthem in march referendum was held with the support of the united nations of the participants voted for complete independence from the netherlands tensions mounted as croes stepped up the pressure on the dutch government by organising general strike in croes later met with dutch prime minister joop den uyl with the two sides agreeing to assign the institute of social studies in the hague to prepare study for independence entitled aruba en achtergronden modaliteiten en mogelijkheden een rapport in eerste aanleg aruba and independence backgrounds

becoming country of the kingdom of the netherlands with full independence planned for however croes was seriously injured in traffic accident in slipping into coma he died in never seeing the enaction of status aparte for aruba for which he had worked over many years after his death in croes was proclaimed libertador di aruba thus henny eman of the aruban people party avp became the first prime minister of aruba meanwhile aruba oil refinery shut negatively impacting the economy as result aruba pushed for dramatic increase in tourism with this sector growing to become the island largest industry at convention in the hague in at the request of aruba prime minister nelson oduber the governments of aruba the netherlands and the netherlands antilles postponed indefinitely aruba

the articles of confederation and perpetual union was an agreement among the original states of the united states of america that served as its first constitution it was approved after much debate between july and november by the second continental congress on november and sent to the states for ratification the articles of confederation came into force on march after being ratified by all states guiding principle of the articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states the weak central government established by the articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament the document provided clearly written rules for how the states league of friendship would be organized during the ratification process the congress looked to the articles for guidance as it conducted business directing the war effort conducting diplomacy with foreign states addressing territorial issues and dealing with native american relations little changed politically once the articles of confederation went into effect as ratification did little more than legalize what the continental congress had been doing that body was renamed the congress of the confederation but most americans continued to call it the continental congress since its organization remained the same as the confederation congress attempted to govern the continually growing american states delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so as the government weaknesses became apparent especially after shays rebellion some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the articles their hope was to create stronger government initially some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems however as more states became interested in meeting to change the articles meeting was set in philadelphia on may this became the constitutional convention it was quickly agreed that changes would not work and instead the entire articles needed to be replaced on march the government under the articles was replaced with the federal government under the constitution the new constitution provided for much stronger federal government by establishing chief executive the president courts and taxing powers background and context the political push to increase cooperation among the then loyal colonies began with the albany congress in and benjamin franklin proposed albany plan an inter colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems over the next two decades some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen others would weaken especially in the degree of loyalty or lack thereof owed the crown civil disobedience resulted in coercive and quelling measures such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the intolerable acts in the british parliament and armed skirmishes which resulted in dissidents being proclaimed rebels these actions eroded the number of crown loyalists tories among the colonials and together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the patriot leaders caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country in with events outpacing communications the second continental congress began acting as the provisional government it was an era of constitution writing most states were busy at the task and leaders felt the new nation must have written constitution rulebook for how the new nation should function during the war congress exercised an unprecedented level of political diplomatic military and economic authority it adopted trade restrictions established and maintained an army issued fiat money created military code and negotiated with foreign governments to transform themselves from outlaws into legitimate nation the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it in early thomas paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of common sense that the custom of nations demanded formal declaration of american independence if any european power were to mediate peace between the americans and great britain the monarchies of france and spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch foreign courts needed to have american grievances laid before them persuasively in manifesto which could also reassure them that the americans would be reliable trading partners without such declaration paine concluded the custom of all courts is against us and will be so until by an independence we take rank with other nations beyond improving their existing association the records of the second continental congress show that the need for declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations on june richard henry lee introduced resolution before the continental congress declaring the colonies independent at the same time he also urged congress to resolve to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign alliances and to prepare plan of confederation for the newly independent states congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the declaration model treaty and the articles of confederation the declaration announced the states entry into the international system the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states and the articles of confederation which established firm league among the thirteen free and independent states constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs drafting cent postage stamp commemorating the articles of confederation bicentennial the draft was completed on november on june day after appointing committee to prepare draft of the declaration of independence the second continental congress resolved to appoint committee of to prepare draft of constitution for union of the states the committee met frequently and chairman john dickinson presented their results to the congress on july afterward there were long debates on such issues as state sovereignty the exact powers to be given to congress whether to have judiciary western land claims and voting procedures to further complicate work on the constitution congress was forced to leave philadelphia twice for baltimore maryland in the winter of and later for lancaster then york pennsylvania in the fall of to evade advancing british troops even so the committee continued with its work the final draft of the articles of confederation and perpetual union was completed on november consensus was achieved by including language guaranteeing that each state retained its sovereignty leaving the matter of western land claims in the hands of the individual states including language stating that votes in congress would be en bloc by state and establishing unicameral legislature with limited and clearly delineated powers ratification the articles of confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in late november the first state to ratify was virginia on december states had ratified the articles by february months into the process the lone holdout maryland refused to go along until the landed states especially virginia had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the ohio river to the union it would be two years before the maryland general assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through and voted to ratify during this time congress observed the articles as its de facto frame of government maryland

authority to regulate and fund the continental army but it lacked the power to compel the states to comply with requests for either troops or funding this left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding supplies and even food further although the articles enabled the states to present unified front when dealing with the european powers as tool to build centralized war making government they were largely failure historian bruce chadwick wrote the continental congress before the articles were approved had promised soldiers pension of half pay for life however congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation and as the war wound down after the victory at yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer factor no progress was made in congress during the winter of general henry knox who would later become the first secretary of war under the constitution blamed the weaknesses of the articles for the inability of the government to fund the army the army had long been supportive of strong union knox wrote as congress failed to act on the petitions knox wrote to gouverneur morris four years before the philadelphia convention was convened as the present constitution is so defective why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so that is to have convention of the states to form better constitution once the war had been won the continental army was largely disbanded very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against native american attacks meanwhile each of the states had an army or militia and of them had navies the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met in george washington defused the newburgh conspiracy but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced congress to leave philadelphia temporarily the congress from time to time during the revolutionary war requisitioned troops from the states any contributions were voluntary and in the debates of the federalists who supported the proposed new constitution claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally and contributed when the continental army protected their state interests the anti federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the union and contributed to advance its needs dougherty concludes that generally the states behavior validated the federalist analysis this helps explain why the articles of confederation needed reforms foreign policy the treaty of paris which ended hostilities with great britain languished in congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute quorum so that it could be ratified afterward the problem only got worse as congress had no power to enforce attendance rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend session of congress at the time causing difficulties in raising quorum the resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many american nationalists including george washington many of the most prominent national leaders such as washington john adams john hancock and benjamin franklin retired from public life served as foreign delegates or held office in state governments and for the general public local government and self rule seemed quite satisfactory this served to exacerbate congress impotence inherent weaknesses in the confederation frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy in thomas jefferson concerned over the failure of congress to fund an american naval force to confront the barbary pirates wrote in diplomatic correspondence to james monroe that it will be said there is no money in the treasury there never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth furthermore the jay gardoqui treaty with spain also showed weakness in foreign policy in this treaty which was never ratified the united states was to give up rights to use the mississippi river for years which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the appalachian mountains finally due to the confederation military weakness it could not compel the british army to leave frontier forts which were on american soil forts which in the british promised to leave but which they delayed leaving pending implementation of other provisions such as ending action against loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation this incomplete british implementation of the treaty of paris would later be resolved by the implementation of jay treaty in after the federal constitution came into force taxation and commerce under the articles of confederation the central government power was kept quite limited the confederation congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers implementation of most decisions including modifications to the articles required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures congress was denied any powers of taxation it could only request money from the states the states often failed to meet these requests in full leaving both congress and the continental army chronically short of money as more money was printed by congress the continental dollars depreciated in george washington wrote to john jay who was serving as the president of the continental congress that wagon load of money will scarcely purchase wagon load of provisions mr jay and the congress responded in may by requesting million from the states in an appeal to the states to comply jay wrote that the taxes were the price of liberty the peace and the safety of yourselves and posterity he argued that americans should avoid having it said that america had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent or that her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith the states did not respond with any of the money requested from them congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and as result all of the states maintained control over their own trade policies the states and the confederation congress both incurred large debts during the revolutionary war and how to repay those debts became major issue of debate following the war some states paid off their war debts and others did not federal assumption of the states war debts became major issue in the deliberations of the constitutional convention accomplishments nevertheless the confederation congress did take two actions with long lasting impact the land ordinance of and northwest ordinance created territorial government set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units and set aside land in each township for public use this system represented sharp break from imperial colonization as in europe and it established the precedent by which the national later federal government would be sovereign and expand westward as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty the land ordinance of established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the mississippi river frontier lands were surveyed into the now familiar squares of land called the township square miles the section one square mile and the quarter section acres this system was carried forward to most of the states west of the mississippi excluding areas of texas and california that had already been surveyed and divided up by the spanish empire then when the homestead act was enacted in the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler farmers the northwest ordinance of noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims organized the northwest territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states while it didn happen under the articles the land north of the ohio river and west of the present western border of pennsylvania ceded by massachusetts connecticut new york pennsylvania and virginia eventually became the states of ohio indiana illinois michigan and wisconsin and the part of minnesota east of the mississippi river the northwest ordinance of also made great advances in the abolition of slavery new states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states no new states were admitted to the union under the articles of confederation the articles provided for blanket acceptance of the province of quebec referred to as canada in the articles into the united states if it chose to do so it did not and the subsequent constitution carried no such special provision of admission additionally ordinances to admit frankland later modified to franklin kentucky and vermont to the union were considered but none were approved presidents of congress under the articles of confederation the presiding officer of congress referred to in many official records as president of the united states in congress assembled chaired the committee of the states when congress was in recess and performed other administrative functions he was not however an executive in the way the later president of the united states is chief executive since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of congress there were presidents of congress under the articles the first samuel huntington had been serving as president of the continental congress since september president term samuel huntington july thomas mckean november john hanson november elias boudinot november thomas mifflin june richard henry lee november john hancock june nathaniel gorham november arthur st clair november cyrus griffin november the under the articles the peace treaty left the united states independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure the articles envisioned permanent confederation but granted to the congress the only federal institution little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced there was no president no executive agencies no judiciary and no tax base the absence of tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states which seldom arrived although historians generally agree that the articles were too weak to hold the fast growing nation together they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control by with the end of the british blockade the new nation was regaining its prosperity however trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the british and french empires the ports of the british west indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in british ships france and spain established similar policies simultaneously new manufacturers faced sharp competition from british products which were suddenly available again political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the revolution the apparent inability of the congress to redeem the public obligations debts incurred during the war or to become forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development only aggravated gloomy situation in shays rebellion an uprising of dissidents in western massachusetts against the state court system threatened the stability of state government the continental congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency spawning the expression not worth continental congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the states less than million and half dollars came into the treasury between and although the governors had been asked for two million in alone when john adams went to london in as the first representative of the united states he found it impossible to secure treaty for unrestricted commerce demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to treaty adams stated it was necessary for the states to confer the power of passing navigation laws to congress or that the states themselves pass retaliatory acts against great britain congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws meanwhile each state acted individually against great britain to little effect when other new england states closed their ports to british shipping connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports by congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping state legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population the idea of convention to revise the articles of confederation grew in favor alexander hamilton realized while serving as washington top aide that strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual congress hamilton led group of like minded nationalists won washington endorsement and convened the annapolis convention in to petition congress to call constitutional convention to meet in philadelphia to remedy the long term crisis signatures the second continental congress approved the articles for distribution to the states on november copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress on november the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned and the cover letter dated november had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson who were the president and secretary to the congress the articles however were unsigned and the date was blank congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june they ordered final copy prepared the one in the national archives and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification on july the prepared copy was ready they dated it and began to sign they also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed on that date delegates present from new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york pennsylvania virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified new jersey delaware and maryland could not since their states had not ratified north carolina and georgia also were unable to sign that day since their delegations were absent after the first signing some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended for example john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august john penn was the first of north carolina delegates to arrive on july and the delegation signed the articles on july the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation georgia signed on july new jersey on november and delaware on february maryland refused to ratify the articles until every state had ceded its western land claims chevalier de la luzerne french minister to the united states felt that the articles would help strengthen the american government in when maryland requested france provide naval forces in the chesapeake bay for protection from the british who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay he indicated that french admiral destouches would do what he could but la luzerne also sharply pressed maryland to ratify the articles thus suggesting the two issues were related the act of the maryland legislature to ratify the articles of confederation february on february the much awaited decision was taken by the maryland general assembly in annapolis as the last piece of business during the afternoon session among engrossed bills was signed and sealed by governor thomas sim lee in the senate chamber in the presence of the members of both houses an act to empower the delegates of this state in congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation and perpetual union among the states the senate then adjourned to the first monday in august next the decision of maryland to ratify the articles was reported to the continental congress on february the confirmation signing of the articles by the two maryland delegates took place in philadelphia at noon time on march and was celebrated in the afternoon with these events the articles were entered into force and the united states of america came into being as sovereign federal state congress had debated the articles for over year and half and the ratification process had taken nearly three and half years many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates and some of the signers had only recently arrived the articles of confederation and perpetual union were signed by group of men who were never present in the congress at the same time signers the signers and the states they represented were connecticut roger sherman samuel huntington oliver wolcott titus hosmer andrew adams delaware thomas mckean john dickinson

replacement on january the virginia legislature following james madison recommendation invited all the states to send delegates to annapolis maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict at what came to be known as the annapolis convention the few state delegates in attendance endorsed motion that called for all states to meet in philadelphia in may to discuss ways to improve the articles of confederation in grand convention although the states representatives to the constitutional convention in philadelphia were only authorized to amend the articles the representatives held secret closed door sessions and wrote new constitution the new constitution gave much more power to the central government but of the result is disputed the general goal of the authors was to get close to republic as defined by the philosophers of the age of enlightenment while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships historian forrest mcdonald using the ideas of james madison from federalist describes the change this way in may charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations however and congress failed to reach consensus the weakness of the articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states especially after shays rebellion threatened to topple the state government of massachusetts historian ralph ketcham comments on the opinions of patrick henry george mason and other anti federalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in jillson and wilson point to the financial weakness as well as the norms rules and institutional structures of the congress and the propensity to divide along sectional lines rakove identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the confederation the lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power it could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by rhode island rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures stemmed not from heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes mustering men and gathering supplies from war weary populace the second group of factors rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the continental congress confronted after especially the inability to create strong foreign policy finally the confederation lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power when the war ended in certain special interests had incentives to create new merchant state much like the british state people had rebelled against in particular holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims also manufacturers wanted high tariff as barrier to foreign goods but competition among states made this impossible without central government legitimacy of closing down political scientist david hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the confederation john jay of new york and thomas burke of north carolina believed that the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states to which the states gave their voluntary consent and until those obligations were fulfilled neither nullification of the authority of congress exercising its due powers nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges according to article xiii of the confederation any alteration had to be approved unanimously the articles of this confederation shall be inviolably observed by every state and the union shall be perpetual nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them unless such alteration be agreed to in congress of the united states and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state on the other hand article vii of the proposed constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by mere nine states without unanimity the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same the apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time and remains topic of scholarly discussion in james madison remarked in federalist no that the issue had become moot as this objection has been in manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention dismiss it without further observation nevertheless it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the constitution could have plausibly attacked the constitution on that ground at the time there were state legislators who argued that the constitution was not an alteration of the articles of confederation but rather would be complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply moreover the confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding modern scholars such as francisco forrest martin agree that the articles of confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it and thus other states parties did not have to comply with the articles unanimous consent rule in contrast law professor akhil amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the articles of confederation and the constitution on this point article vi of the confederation specifically allowed side deals among states and the constitution could be viewed as side deal until all states ratified it final months on july the congress received new hampshire all important ninth ratification of the proposed constitution thus according to its terms establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states the following day delegates considered bill to admit kentucky into the union as sovereign state the discussion ended with congress making the determination that in light of this development it would be unadvisable to admit kentucky into the union as it could do so under the articles of confederation only but not under the constitution by the end of july of the states had ratified the new constitution congress continued to convene under the articles with quorum until october on saturday september the confederation congress voted the resolve to implement the new constitution and on monday september published an announcement that the new constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states set the first wednesday in february for the presidential electors to meet and select new president and set the first wednesday of march as the day the new government would take over and the government under the articles of confederation would come to an end

atlantic ocean informally the pond is the second largest of the world oceans with an area of about it covers approximately percent of earth surface and about percent of its water surface area it is known to separate the old world from the new world in european perception of the world the atlantic ocean occupies an elongated shaped basin extending longitudinally between europe and africa to the east and the americas to the west as one component of the interconnected world ocean it is connected in the north to the arctic ocean to the pacific ocean in the southwest the indian ocean in the

university lamont doherty earth observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office etymology the aethiopian ocean in french map of africa the oldest known mentions of an atlantic sea come from stesichorus around mid sixth century bc sch greek english the atlantic sea etym sea of atlantis and in the histories of herodotus around bc hdt greek english sea of atlantis or the atlantis sea where the name refers to the sea beyond the pillars of heracles which is said to be part of the sea that surrounds all land in these uses the name refers to atlas the titan in greek mythology who supported the heavens and who later appeared as frontispiece in medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases on the other hand to early greek sailors and in ancient greek mythological literature such as the iliad and the odyssey this all encompassing ocean was instead known as oceanus the gigantic river that encircled the world in contrast to the enclosed seas well known to the greeks the mediterranean and the black sea in contrast the term atlantic originally referred specifically to the atlas mountains in morocco and the sea off the strait of gibraltar and the north african coast the greek word has been reused by scientists for the huge panthalassa ocean that surrounded the supercontinent pangaea hundreds of millions of years ago the term aethiopian ocean derived from ancient ethiopia was applied to the southern atlantic as late as the mid th century during the age of discovery the atlantic was also known to english cartographers as the great western ocean the pond is term often used by british and american speakers in context to the northern atlantic ocean as form of meiosis or sarcastic understatement the term dates to as early as first appearing in print in pamphlet released during the reign of charles and reproduced in in nehemiah wallington historical notices of events occurring chiefly in the reign of charles where great pond is used in reference to the atlantic ocean by francis windebank charles secretary of state extent and data the international hydrographic organization iho defined the limits of the oceans and seas in but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities institutions and countries see for example the cia world factbook correspondingly the extent and number of oceans and seas vary the atlantic ocean is bounded on the west by north and south america it connects to the arctic ocean through the denmark strait greenland sea norwegian sea and barents sea to the east the boundaries of the ocean proper are europe the strait of gibraltar where it connects with the mediterranean sea one of its marginal seas and in turn the black sea both of which also touch upon asia and africa in the southeast the atlantic merges into the indian ocean the east meridian running south from cape agulhas to antarctica defines its border in the definition it extends south to antarctica while in later maps it is bounded at the parallel by the southern ocean the atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays gulfs and seas these include the baltic sea black sea

submarine mountain range called the mid atlantic ridge mar it runs from or south of the north pole to the subantarctic bouvet island at mid atlantic ridge the mar divides the atlantic longitudinally into two halves in each of which series of basins are delimited by secondary transverse ridges the mar reaches above along most of its length but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places the romanche trench near the equator and the gibbs fracture zone at the mar is barrier for bottom water but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other the mar rises above the surrounding ocean floor and its rift valley is the divergent boundary between the north american and eurasian plates in the north atlantic and the south american and african plates in the south atlantic the mar produces basaltic volcanoes in iceland and pillow lava on the ocean floor the depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than in most places while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep the mar is intersected by two perpendicular ridges the azores gibraltar transform fault the boundary between the nubian and eurasian plates intersects the mar at the azores triple junction on either side of the azores microplate near the much vaguer nameless boundary between the north american and south american plates intersects the mar near or just north of the fifteen twenty fracture zone approximately at in the the challenger expedition discovered parts of what is now known as the mid atlantic ridge or the remainder of the ridge was discovered in the by the german meteor expedition using echo sounding equipment the exploration of the mar in the led to the general acceptance of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics most of the mar runs under water

temperature variations values may vary by from october to june the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the labrador sea denmark strait and baltic sea the coriolis effect circulates north atlantic water in clockwise direction whereas south atlantic water circulates counter clockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi diurnal that is two high tides occur during every lunar hours in latitudes above north some east west oscillation known as the north atlantic oscillation occurs salinity on average the atlantic is the saltiest major ocean surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from to parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season evaporation precipitation river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator because of heavy tropical rainfall in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter maximum salinity values occur at about north and south in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation the high surface salinity in the atlantic on which the atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent is maintained by two processes the agulhas leakage rings which brings salty indian ocean waters into the south atlantic and the atmospheric bridge which evaporates subtropical atlantic

flows from north to become the source for north atlantic deep water south of the greenland scotland sill these two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins the wide range of salinities in the north atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from wide range of sources labrador sea norwegian

upper labrador sea water and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the greenland iceland scotland sill denmark strait and iceland scotland overflow water along its path across earth the composition of the nadw is affected by other water masses especially antarctic bottom water and mediterranean overflow water the nadw is fed by flow of warm shallow water into the northern north atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in europe changes in the formation of nadw have been linked to global climate changes in the past since man made substances were introduced

atlantic surface circulation is dominated by three inter connected currents the gulf stream which flows north east from the north american coast at cape hatteras the north atlantic current branch of the gulf stream which flows northward from the grand banks and the subpolar front an extension of the north atlantic current wide vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre this system of currents transport warm water into the north atlantic without which temperatures in the north atlantic and europe would plunge dramatically in the subpolar gyre of the north atlantic warm subtropical waters are transformed into colder subpolar and polar waters in the labrador sea this water flows back to the subtropical gyre north of the north atlantic gyre the cyclonic north atlantic subpolar gyre plays key role in climate variability it is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography rather than being steered by wind both in the deep ocean and at sea level the subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the north atlantic current which transport warm saline waters from the subtropics to the north eastern atlantic there this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of greenland where they form an intense sv current which flows around the continental margins of the labrador sea third of this water becomes part of the deep portion of the north atlantic deep water nadw the nadw in its turn feeds the meridional overturning circulation moc the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change large variations in the subpolar gyre on decade century scale associated with the north atlantic oscillation are especially pronounced in labrador sea water the upper layers of the moc the south atlantic is dominated by the anti cyclonic southern subtropical gyre the south atlantic central water originates in this gyre while antarctic intermediate water originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region near the drake passage and the falkland islands both these currents receive some contribution from the indian ocean on the african east coast the small cyclonic angola gyre lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre the southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by wind induced ekman layer the residence time of the gyre is years north atlantic deep water flows southward below the thermocline of the subtropical gyre sargasso sea approximate extent of the sargasso sea the sargasso sea in the western north atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of sargassum fluitans and natans float an area wide and encircled by the gulf stream north atlantic drift and north equatorial current this population of seaweed probably originated from tertiary ancestors on the european shores of the former tethys ocean and has if so maintained itself by vegetative growth floating in the ocean for millions of years sargassum fish histrio histrio other species endemic to the sargasso sea include the sargassum fish predator with algae like appendages which hovers motionless among the sargassum fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former tethys ocean in what is now the carpathian region that were similar to the sargasso sea it is possible that the population in the sargasso sea migrated to the atlantic as the tethys closed at the end of the miocene around ma the origin of the sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries the fossils found in the carpathians in the mid th century often called the quasi sargasso assemblage finally showed that this assemblage originated in the carpathian basin from where it migrated over sicily to the central atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the sargasso sea the location of the spawning ground for european eels remained unknown for decades in the early th century it was discovered that the southern sargasso sea is the spawning ground for both the european and american eel and that the former migrate more than and the latter ocean currents such as the gulf stream transport eel larvae from the sargasso sea to foraging areas in north america europe and northern africa recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use earth magnetic field to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults climate waves in the alt map of caribbean showing seven approximately parallel westward pointing arrows that extend from east of the virgin islands to cuba the southern arrows bend northward just east of the dominican republic before straightening out again san andrés island caribbean colombia climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds because of the ocean great capacity to store and release heat maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude the warmest zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents influence the climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas the gulf stream and its northern extension towards europe the north atlantic drift is thought to have at least some influence on climate for example the gulf stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern north america keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas the gulf stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the florida peninsula in the higher latitudes the north atlantic drift warms the atmosphere over the oceans keeping the british isles and north western europe mild and cloudy and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern canada the grand banks of newfoundland area and africa north western coast in general winds transport moisture and air over land areas natural hazards iceberg in the south atlantic ocean every winter the icelandic low produces frequent storms icebergs are common from early february to the end of july across the shipping lanes near the grand banks of newfoundland the ice season is longer in the polar regions but there is little shipping in those areas hurricanes are hazard in the western parts of the north atlantic during the summer and autumn due to consistently strong wind shear and weak intertropical convergence zone south atlantic tropical cyclones are rare geology and plate tectonics the break up of pangaea resulted in the opening of the atlantic ocean in three stages the atlantic ocean is underlain mostly by dense mafic oceanic crust made up of basalt and gabbro and overlain by fine clay silt and siliceous ooze on the abyssal plain the continental margins and continental shelf mark lower density but greater thickness felsic continental rock that often much older than that of the seafloor the oldest oceanic crust in the atlantic is up to million years and situated off the west coast of africa and east coast of north america or on either side of the south atlantic in many places the continental shelf and continental slope are covered in thick sedimentary layers for instance on the north american side of the ocean large carbonate deposits formed in warm shallow waters such as florida and the bahamas while coarse river outwash sands and silt are common in shallow shelf areas like the georges bank coarse sand boulders and rocks were transported into some areas such as off the coast of nova scotia or the gulf of maine during the pleistocene ice ages central atlantic the break up of pangaea began in the central atlantic between north america and northwest africa where rift basins opened during the late triassic and early jurassic this period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the atlas mountains the exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from to ma the opening of the atlantic ocean coincided with the initial break up of the supercontinent pangaea both of which were initiated by the eruption of the central atlantic magmatic province camp one of the most extensive and voluminous large igneous provinces in earth history associated with the triassic jurassic extinction event one of earth major extinction events theoliitic dikes sills and lava flows from the camp eruption at ma have been found in west africa eastern north america and northern south america the extent of the volcanism has been estimated to of which covered what is now northern and central brazil the formation of the central american isthmus closed the central american seaway at the end of the pliocene ma ago the formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many land living animals known as the great american interchange but the closure of the seaway resulted in great american schism as it affected ocean currents salinity and temperatures in both the atlantic and pacific marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct geologically the northern atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins newfoundland and iberia and to the north by the arctic eurasian basin the opening of the northern atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor the iapetus ocean and spread from the central atlantic in six stages iberia newfoundland porcupine north america eurasia greenland eurasia north america active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the iceland hotspot seafloor spreading led to the extension of the crust and formations of troughs and sedimentary basins the rockall trough opened between and million years ago although along the rift failed along with one leading into the bay of biscay spreading began opening the labrador sea around million years ago continuing until million years ago geologists distinguish two magmatic phases one from to million years ago predates the separation of greenland from northern europe while the second from to million years ago happened as the separation occurred iceland began to form million years ago due to particularly concentrated mantle plume large quantities of basalt erupted at this time period are found on baffin island greenland the faroe islands and scotland with ash falls in western europe acting as stratigraphic marker the opening of the north atlantic caused significant uplift of continental crust along the coast for instance in spite of km thick basalt gunnbjorn field in east greenland is the highest point on the island elevated enough that it exposes older mesozoic sedimentary rocks at its base similar to old lava fields above sedimentary rocks in the uplifted hebrides of western scotland south atlantic west gondwana south america and africa broke up in the early cretaceous to form the south atlantic the apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the south atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computer assisted plate tectonic reconstructions in this magnificent fit however has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northward propagating break up intra continental rifts and deformations have also been introduced to subdivide both continental plates into sub plates geologically the south atlantic can be divided into four segments equatorial segment from to the romanche fracture zone rfz central segment from rfz to florianopolis fracture zone ffz north of walvis ridge and rio grande rise southern segment from ffz to the agulhas falkland fracture zone affz and falkland segment south of affz in the southern segment the early cretaceous ma intensive magmatism of the paraná etendeka large igneous province produced by the tristan hotspot resulted in an estimated volume of it covered an area of in brazil paraguay and uruguay and in africa dyke swarms in brazil angola eastern paraguay and namibia however suggest the lip originally covered much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the falkland islands and south africa traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to ma with two peaks between and ma and ma in the falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the patagonia and colorado sub plates between the early jurassic ma and the early cretaceous ma around ma sea floor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment no later than ma rifting had reached the walvis ridge rio grande rise in the central segment rifting started to break africa in two by opening the benue trough around ma rifting in the central segment however coincided with the cretaceous normal superchron also known as the cretaceous quiet period ma period without magnetic reversals which makes it difficult to date sea floor spreading in this segment the equatorial segment is the last phase of the break up but because it is located on the equator magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating various estimates date the propagation of sea floor spreading in this segment to the period ma this final stage nevertheless coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in africa about ma the opening of the drake passage resulted from change in the motions and separation rate of the south american and antarctic plates first small ocean basins opened and shallow gateway appeared during the middle eocene ma deeper seaway developed followed by an eocene oligocene climatic deterioration and the growth of the antarctic ice sheet closure of the atlantic an embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of gibraltar the gibraltar arc in the western mediterranean is migrating westward into the central atlantic where it joins the converging african and eurasian plates together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into new subduction system in the eastern atlantic basin meanwhile the scotia arc and caribbean plate in the western atlantic basin are eastward propagating subduction systems that might together with the gibraltar system represent the beginning of the closure of the atlantic ocean and the final stage of the atlantic wilson cycle history human origin humans evolved in africa first by diverging from other apes around mya then developing stone tools around mya to finally evolve as modern humans around kya the earliest evidence for the complex behavior associated with this behavioral modernity has been found in the greater cape floristic region gcfr along the coast of south africa during the latest glacial stages the now submerged plains of the agulhas bank were exposed above sea level extending the south african coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers small population of modern humans probably fewer than thousand reproducing individuals survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these palaeo agulhas plains the gcfr is delimited to the north by the cape fold belt and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex stone age technologies emerged human history thus begins on the coasts of south africa where the atlantic benguela upwelling and indian ocean agulhas current meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish fur seal fish and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources the african origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by years old engravings from blombos cave south africa old world mitochondrial dna mtdna studies indicate that years ago major demographic expansion within africa derived from single small population coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid mis environmental changes this group of people not only expanded over the whole of africa but also started to disperse out of africa into asia europe and australasia around years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions during the last glacial maximum lgm years ago humans had to abandon their initial settlements along the european north atlantic coast and retreat to the mediterranean following rapid climate changes at the end of the lgm this region was repopulated by magdalenian culture other hunter gatherers followed in waves interrupted by large scale hazards such as the laacher see volcanic eruption the inundation of doggerland now the north sea and the formation of the baltic sea the european coasts of the north atlantic were permanently populated about thousand years ago this human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the atlantic ocean kya old deeply stratified shell middens found in ysterfontein on the western coast of south africa are associated with the middle stone age msa the msa population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations while their middens resemble kya old late stone age lsa middens found on every inhabited continent the kya old enkapune ya muto in kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of africa ertebølle middens in the same development can be seen in europe in la riera cave kya in asturias spain only some molluscs were deposited over kya in contrast kya old shell middens in portugal denmark and brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts the ertebølle middens in denmark for example accumulated of shell deposits representing some million molluscs over only thousand years this intensification in the exploitation of marine resources has been described as accompanied by new technologies such as boats harpoons and fish hooks because many caves found in the mediterranean and on the european atlantic coast have increased quantities of marine shells in their upper levels and reduced quantities in their lower the earliest exploitation however took place on the now submerged shelves and most settlements now excavated were then located several kilometers from these shelves the reduced quantities of shells in the lower levels can represent the few shells that were exported inland new world during the lgm the laurentide ice sheet covered most of northern north america while beringia connected siberia to alaska in late american geoscientist paul martin proposed blitzkrieg colonization of the americas by which clovis hunters migrated into north america around years ago in single wave through an ice free corridor in the ice sheet and spread southward explosively briefly attaining density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey others later proposed three wave migration over the bering land bridge these hypotheses remained the long held view regarding the settlement of the americas view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries the oldest archaeological sites in the americas have been found in south america sites in north east siberia report virtually no human presence there during the lgm and most clovis artefacts have been found in eastern north america along the atlantic coast furthermore colonisation models based on mtdna ydna and atdna data respectively support neither the blitzkrieg nor the three wave hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will eventually confirm each other proposed route across the pacific to south america could explain early south american finds and another hypothesis proposes northern path through the canadian arctic and down the north american atlantic coast early settlements across the atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed including the solutrean hypothesis and some of the pre columbian trans oceanic contact theories íslendingasögur sagas including the grœnlendinga saga this interpretative map of the norse world shows that norse knowledge of the americas and the atlantic remained limited the norse settlement of the faroe islands and iceland began during the th and th centuries settlement on greenland was established before ce but contact with it was lost in and it was finally abandoned during the early little ice age this setback was caused by range of factors an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation while conflicts with the local inuit resulted in the failure to adapt their arctic technologies colder climate resulted in starvation and the colony got economically marginalized as the great plague and barbary pirates harvested its victims on iceland in the th century iceland was initially settled ce following warm period when winter temperatures hovered around which made farming favorable at high latitudes this did not last however and temperatures quickly dropped at ce summer temperatures had reached maximum of the landnámabók book of settlement records disastrous famines during the first century of settlement men ate foxes and ravens and the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs and by the early hay had to be abandoned for short season crops such as barley atlantic world spanish and portuguese empires christopher columbus reached the americas in under spanish flag six years later vasco da gama reached india under the portuguese flag by navigating south around the cape of good hope thus proving that the atlantic and indian oceans are connected in in his voyage to india following vasco da gama pedro alvares cabral reached brazil taken by the currents of the south atlantic gyre following these explorations spain and portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the new world and forced the amerindian population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found spain and portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other european nations out but conflicting interests nevertheless led to series of spanish portuguese wars peace treaty mediated by the pope divided the conquered territories into spanish and portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away england france and the dutch republic enviously watched the spanish and portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with pirates such as henry mainwaring and alexandre exquemelin they could explore the convoys leaving the americas because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable embarked and disembarked slaves in the atlantic slave trade first and last slave voyages in the colonies of the americas depredation smallpox and others diseases and slavery quickly reduced the indigenous population of the americas to the extent that the atlantic slave trade had to be introduced to replace them trade that became the norm and an integral part of the colonization between the th century and when brazil became the last part of the americas to end the slave trade an estimated ten million africans were exported as slaves most of them destined for agricultural labour the slave trade was officially abolished in the british empire and the united states in and slavery itself was abolished in the british empire in and in the united states in after the civil war from columbus to the industrial revolution trans atlantic trade including colonialism and slavery became crucial for western europe for european countries with direct access to the atlantic including britain france the netherlands portugal and spain was period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in eastern europe and asia colonialism evolved as part of the trans atlantic trade but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs growth was more rapid in non absolutist countries such as britain and the netherlands and more limited in absolutist monarchies such as portugal spain and france where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies trans atlantic trade also resulted in increasing urbanization in european countries facing the atlantic urbanization grew from in in to in in other european countries from in in to in likewise gdp doubled in atlantic countries but rose by only in the rest of europe by end of the th century the volume of the trans atlantic trade had surpassed that of the mediterranean trade economy the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves cod fishery in norway the atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields fish marine mammals seals and whales sand and gravel aggregates placer deposits polymetallic nodules and precious stones gold deposits are mile or two under water on the ocean floor however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through currently there is no cost effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make profit various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea fisheries the shelves of the atlantic hosts one of the world richest fishing resources the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the scotian shelf georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the bay of fundy the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks fisheries have however undergone significant changes since the and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the atlantic fisheries in the eastern central and south west atlantic oscillate around globally stable value the rest of the atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks the third group continuously increasing trend since is only found in the indian ocean and western pacific banks of the north east atlantic in the north east atlantic total catches decreased between the mid and the and reached million tons in blue whiting reached million tons peak in but was down to tons in recovery plans for cod sole and plaice have reduced mortality in these species arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the but is now recovered arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished limited data makes the state of redfishes and deep water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing stocks of northern shrimp and norwegian lobster are in good condition in the north east atlantic of stocks are considered overfished banks of the north west atlantic in the north west atlantic landings have decreased from million tons in the early to million tons in during the st century some species have shown weak signs of recovery including greenland halibut yellowtail flounder atlantic halibut haddock spiny dogfish while other stocks shown no such signs including cod witch flounder and redfish stocks of invertebrates in contrast remain at record levels of abundance of stocks are overfished in the north west atlantic capture of atlantic north west cod in million tons in john cabot became the first western european since the vikings to explore mainland north america and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of atlantic cod off newfoundland referred to as newfoundland currency this discovery yielded some million tons of fish over five centuries in the late th and early th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock mackerel and lobster from the to the the introduction of european and asian distant water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and the number of exploited species it also expanded the exploited areas from near shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep water species such as redfish greenland halibut witch flounder and grenadiers overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the but because this was occurring on international waters it took until the late before any attempts to regulate was made in the early this finally resulted in the collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery the population of number of deep sea fishes also collapsed in the process including american plaice redfish and greenland halibut together with flounder and grenadier in the eastern central atlantic small pelagic fishes constitute about of landings with sardine reaching million tons per year pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fished or overfished with sardines south of cape bojador the notable exception almost half of the stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels total catches have been fluctuating since the reaching million tons in or slightly less than the peak production in

pollution in the baltic sea north sea and mediterranean sea north atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature sst at tropical latitudes changes that can be attributed to either the natural atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo or to anthropogenic climate change report indicated that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc slowed down by between and if the amo were responsible for sst variability the amoc would have increased in strength which is apparently not the case furthermore it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity therefore these changes in sst must be caused by human activities the ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal time scales whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have heat capacity about times that of the mixed layer this heat uptake provides time lag for climate change but it also results in thermal expansion of the oceans which contributes to sea level rise st century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea level rise five times

arthur schopenhauer february september was german philosopher he is best known for his work the world as will and representation expanded in which characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of blind and insatiable metaphysical will building on the transcendental idealism of immanuel kant schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of german idealism he was among the first thinkers in western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of indian philosophy such as asceticism denial of the self and the notion of the world as appearance his work has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime schopenhauer had posthumous impact across various disciplines including philosophy literature and science his writing on aesthetics morality and psychology have influenced many thinkers and artists those who have cited his influence include philosophers such as friedrich nietzsche ludwig wittgenstein and anthony ludovici scientists such as erwin schrödinger and albert einstein psychoanalysts such as sigmund freud and carl jung writers such as leo tolstoy herman melville thomas mann george bernard shaw machado de assis jorge luis borges and samuel beckett and notably the composer richard wagner life early life schopenhauer birthplace house ul św ducha formerly schopenhauer was born on february in danzig then part of the polish lithuanian commonwealth present day gdańsk poland on present day św ducha the son of johanna schopenhauer née trosiener and heinrich floris schopenhauer both descendants of wealthy german dutch patrician families neither of them was very religious both supported the french revolution and were republicans cosmopolitans and anglophiles when danzig became part of prussia in heinrich moved to hamburg free city with republican constitution protected by britain and holland against prussian aggression although his firm continued trading in danzig where most of their extended families remained adele arthur only sibling was born on july in arthur was sent to le havre to live for two years with the family of his father business associate grégoire de blésimaire he seemed to enjoy his stay there learned to speak french fluently and started friendship with jean anthime grégoire de blésimaire his peer which lasted for large part of their lives as early as arthur started playing the flute in he joined his parents on their long tour of holland britain france switzerland austria and prussia it was mostly pleasure tour although heinrich also visited some of his business associates heinrich gave his son choice he could stay at home and start preparations for university education or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious he spent twelve weeks of the tour attending school in wimbledon where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow anglican religiosity which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general anglophilia he was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results heinrich became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health in heinrich died by drowning in canal by their home in hamburg although it was possible that his death was accidental his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior anxiety and depression which became especially pronounced in his last months of life arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father side of family his mother johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable despite the hardships schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in positive light heinrich schopenhauer left the family with significant inheritance that was split in three among johanna and the children arthur schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority he invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of university professor schopenhauer as youth arthur spent two years as merchant in honor of his dead father and because of his own doubts about being too old to start life of scholar most of his prior education was practical merchant training and he had some trouble with learning latin which was prerequisite for any academic career his mother moved with her daughter adele to weimar then the centre of german literature to enjoy social life among writers and artists arthur and his mother were not on good terms in one letter to him she wrote you are unbearable and burdensome and very hard to live with all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people arthur left his mother and though she died years later they never met again some negative opinions of the later philosopher about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother arthur lived in hamburg with his friend jean anthime who was also studying to become merchant after quitting his merchant apprenticeship with some encouragement from his mother he dedicated himself to studies at the ernestine gymnasium gotha in saxe gotha altenburg but he also enjoyed social life among the local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother he left the gymnasium after writing satirical poem about one of the schoolmasters although arthur claimed that he left voluntarily his mother letter indicates that he was expelled education he moved to weimar but didn live with his mother who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn get along very well their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences he accused his mother of being financially irresponsible flirtatious and seeking to remarry which he considered an insult to his father memory his mother while professing her love to him criticized him sharply for being moody tactless and argumentative and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls parties and theater by that time johanna famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries most celebrated of them being goethe arthur attended her parties usually when he knew that goethe would be there though the famous writer and statesman didn even seem to notice the young and unknown student it is possible that goethe kept distance because johanna warned him about her son depressive and combative nature or because goethe was then on bad terms with arthur language instructor and roommate franz passow schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful karoline jagemann mistress of karl august grand duke of saxe weimar eisenach and he wrote to her his only known love poem despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs usually with women of lower social status such as servants actresses and sometimes even paid prostitutes in letter to his friend anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out of wedlock daughters born in and both of whom died in infancy in their youthful correspondence arthur and anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits but schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn find him very charming or physically attractive and his desires often remained unfulfilled he left weimar to become student at the university of göttingen in there are no written reasons about why schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous university of jena but göttingen was known as more modern scientifically oriented with less attention given to theology law or medicine were usual choices for young men of schopenhauer status who also needed career and income he chose medicine due to his scientific interests among his notable professors were bernhard friedrich thibaut arnold hermann ludwig heeren johann friedrich blumenbach friedrich stromeyer heinrich adolf schrader johann tobias mayer and konrad johann martin langenbeck he studied metaphysics psychology and logic under gottlob ernst schulze the author of aenesidemus who made strong impression and advised him to concentrate on plato and immanuel kant he decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around and he left göttingen which didn have strong philosophy program besides schulze the only other philosophy professor was friedrich bouterwek whom schopenhauer disliked he didn regret his medicinal and scientific studies he claimed that they were necessary for philosopher and even in berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy during his days at göttingen he spent considerable time studying but also continued his flute playing and social life his friends included friedrich gotthilf osann karl witte christian charles josias von bunsen and william backhouse astor sr he arrived to the newly founded university of berlin for the winter semester of at the same time his mother just started her literary career she published her first book in biography of her friend karl ludwig fernow which was critical success arthur attended lectures by the prominent post kantian philosopher johann gottlieb fichte but quickly found many points of disagreement with his and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand he later mentioned fichte only in critical negative terms seeing his philosophy as lower quality version of kant and considering it useful only because fichte poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of kantianism he also attended the lectures of the famous protestant theologian friedrich schleiermacher whom he also quickly came to dislike his notes and comments on schleiermacher lectures show that schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards atheism he learned by self directed reading besides plato kant and fichte he also read the works of schelling fries jacobi bacon locke and much current scientific literature he attended philological courses by august böckh and friedrich august wolf and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by martin heinrich klaproth paul erman johann elert bode ernst gottfried fischer johann horkel friedrich christian rosenthal and hinrich lichtenstein lichtenstein was also friend whom he met at one of his mother parties in weimar early work schopenhauer left berlin in rush in fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as prussia just joined the war against france he returned to weimar but left after less than month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover georg friedrich konrad ludwig müller von gerstenbergk civil servant twelve years younger than she was he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father memory he settled for while in rudolstadt hoping that no army would pass through the small town he spent his time in solitude hiking in the mountains and the thuringian forest and writing his dissertation on the fourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason he completed his dissertation at about the same time as the french army was defeated at the battle of leipzig he became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother invitation to visit her in weimar she tried to convince him that her relationship with gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying but schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented pretentious and nationalistic his mother just published her second book reminiscences of journey in the years and description of their family tour of europe which quickly became hit she found his dissertation and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy copy in fit of temper arthur told her that people would read his work long after the rubbish she wrote was totally forgotten in fact although they considered her novels of dubious quality the brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well hans brockhaus later claimed that his predecessors saw nothing in this manuscript but wanted to please one of our best selling authors by publishing her son work we published more and more of her son arthur work and today nobody remembers johanna but her son works are in steady demand and contribute to brockhaus reputation he kept large portraits of the pair in his office in leipzig for the edification of his new editors also contrary to his mother prediction schopenhauer dissertation made an impression on goethe to whom he sent it as gift although it is doubtful that goethe agreed with schopenhauer philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education their subsequent meetings and correspondence were great honor to young philosopher who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero they mostly discussed goethe newly published and somewhat lukewarmly received work on color theory schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject on vision and colors which in many points differed from his teacher although they remained polite towards each other their growing theoretical disagreements and especially schopenhauer tactless criticisms and extreme self confidence soon made goethe become distant again and after their correspondence became less frequent schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection but he continued to praise goethe and considered his color theory great introduction to his own another important experience during his stay in weimar was his acquaintance with friedrich majer historian of religion orientalist and disciple of herder who introduced him to eastern philosophy see also indology schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the upanishads he called them the production of the highest human wisdom and believed they contained superhuman concepts and the buddha and put them at par with plato and kant he continued his studies by reading the bhagavad gita an amateurish german journal asiatisches magazin and asiatick researches by the asiatic society schopenhauer held profound respect for indian philosophy although he loved hindu texts he was more interested in buddhism which he came to regard as the best religion however his studies on hindu and buddhist texts were constrained by the lack of adequate literature and the latter were mostly restricted to early buddhism he also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas independently and only later realized the similarities with buddhism schopenhauer in portrait by ludwig sigismund ruhl as the relationship with his mother fell to new low he left weimar and moved to dresden in may he continued his philosophical studies enjoyed the cultural life socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs his friends in dresden were johann gottlob von quandt friedrich laun karl christian friedrich krause and ludwig sigismund ruhl young painter who made romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of schopenhauer unattractive physical features his criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public however his main occupation during his stay in dresden was his seminal philosophical work the world as will and representation which he started writing in and finished in he was recommended to friedrich arnold brockhaus by baron ferdinand von biedenfeld an acquaintance of his mother although the publisher accepted his manuscript schopenhauer made poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude and very poor sales of the book after it was published in december in september while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy schopenhauer left dresden for yearlong vacation in italy he visited venice bologna florence naples and milan travelling alone or accompanied by mostly english tourists he met he spent winter months in rome where he accidentally met his acquaintance karl witte and engaged in numerous quarrels with german tourists in caffe greco among them johann friedrich böhmer who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character he enjoyed art architecture ancient ruins attended plays and operas continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs one of his affairs supposedly became serious and for while he contemplated marriage to rich italian noblewoman but despite his mentioning this several times no details are known and it may have been schopenhauer exaggerating he corresponded regularly with his sister adele and became close to her as her relationship with johanna and gerstenbergk also deteriorated she informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of muhl in danzig in which her mother invested their whole savings and arthur third of his was near bankruptcy arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments the women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while arthur using his business knowledge took suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full the affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of schopenhauer family he shortened his stay in italy because of the trouble with muhl and returned to dresden disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him both with income and the opportunity to promote his views he contacted his friends at universities in heidelberg göttingen and berlin and found berlin most attractive he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher hegel whom schopenhauer described as clumsy charlatan he was especially appalled by hegel supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in quarrel about it already at his test lecture in march hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were fired while schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own hegel still voted to accept schopenhauer to the university however only five students turned up to schopenhauer lectures and he dropped out of academia late essay on university philosophy expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies later life sculpture of arthur schopenhauer by gdańsk based artist giennadij jerszow after his academic failure he continued to travel extensively visiting leipzig nuremberg stuttgart schaffhausen vevey milan and spending eight months in florence however before he left for his three year travel he had an incident with his berlin neighbor forty seven year old seamstress caroline louise marquet the details of the august incident are unknown he claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him she claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work she immediately sued him and the process lasted until may when court found schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in schopenhauer enjoyed italy where he studied art and socialized with italian and english nobles it was his last visit to the country he left for munich and stayed there for year mostly recuperating from various health issues some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases the treatment his doctor used suggests syphilis he contacted publishers offering to translate hume into german and kant into english but his proposals were declined returning to berlin he began to study spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language he liked pedro calderón de la barca lope de vega miguel de cervantes and especially baltasar gracián he also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works few attempts to revive his lectures again scheduled at the same time as hegel also failed as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities during his berlin years schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have family for while he was unsuccessfully courting year old flora weiss who was years younger than he was his unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of monogamy but still not advocating polygyny instead musing about polyamorous relationship he called tetragamy he had an on and off relationship with young dancer caroline richter she also used surname medon after one of her ex lovers they met when he was and she was and working at the berlin opera she had already had numerous lovers and son out of wedlock and later gave birth to another son this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat she soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn as schopenhauer was preparing to escape berlin in due to cholera epidemic he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left behind her young son she refused and he went alone in his will he left her significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son schopenhauer claimed that in his last year in berlin he had prophetic dream that urged him to escape the city as he arrived in his new home in frankfurt he supposedly had another supernatural experience an apparition of his dead father and his mother who was still alive this experience led him to spend some time investigating paranormal phenomena and magic he was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will upon his arrival in frankfurt he experienced period of depression and declining health he renewed his correspondence with his mother and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father by now johanna and adele were living very modestly johanna writing didn bring her much income and her popularity was waning their correspondence remained reserved and arthur schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in his relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in in july schopenhauer left frankfurt for mannheim but returned in july to remain there for the rest of his life except for few short journeys he lived alone except for succession of pet poodles named atman and butz in he published on the will in nature in he sent his essay on the freedom of the will to the contest of the royal norwegian society of sciences and won the prize next year he sent another essay on the basis of morality to the royal danish society for scientific studies but didn win the prize despite being the only contestant the society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in very offensive manner claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate schopenhauer who was very self confident that he would win was enraged by this rejection he published both essays as the two basic problems of ethics and in the preface to the second edition of this book in he was still pouring insults on royal danish society first edition published in again failed to draw attention to his philosophy two years later after some negotiations he managed to convince his publisher brockhaus to print the second updated edition of the world as will and representation the book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative however schopenhauer did start to attract some followers mostly outside academia among practical professionals several of them were lawyers who pursued private philosophical studies he jokingly referred to them as evangelists and apostles one of the most active early followers was julius frauenstädt who wrote numerous articles promoting schopenhauer philosophy he was also instrumental in finding another publisher after brockhaus refused to publish parerga and paralipomena believing that it would be another failure though schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas frauenstädt continued to promote schopenhauer work they renewed their communication in and schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate he also became the editor of the first collected works of schopenhauer in schopenhauer witnessed violent upheaval in frankfurt after general hans adolf erdmann von auerswald and prince felix lichnowsky were murdered he became worried for his own safety and property even earlier in life he had such worries and kept sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves he gave friendly welcome to austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels the rebellion passed without any loss to schopenhauer and he later praised alfred prince of windisch grätz for restoring order he even modified his will leaving large part of his property to prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in or the families of soldiers who died in battle as young hegelians were advocating change and progress schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans and that even if some utopian society were established people would still fight each other out of boredom or would starve due to overpopulation painting of schopenhauer by jules lunteschütz in schopenhauer published parerga and paralipomena which as the title says contains essays that are supplementary to his main work it was his first successful widely read book partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews the essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system many academic philosophers considered him great stylist and cultural critic but didn take his philosophy seriously his early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those fichte and schelling or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy both criticisms enraged schopenhauer however he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights but encouraged his disciples to do so his private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions inconsistencies and vagueness in his philosophy but claimed that he wasn concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions and that some of his ideas shouldn be taken literally but instead as metaphors academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work in university of leipzig sponsored an essay contest about schopenhauer philosophy which was won by rudolf seydel very critical essay schopenhauer friend jules lunteschütz made first of his four portraits of him which schopenhauer didn particularly like that was soon sold to wealthy landowner carl ferdinand wiesike who built house to display it schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this and would claim that it was his first chapel as his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works people visited frankfurt englischer hof to observe him dining admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs he complained however that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age grave at frankfurt hauptfriedhof he remained healthy in his old age which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather and always getting enough sleep he had great appetite and could read without glasses but his hearing was declining since his youth and he developed problems with rheumatism he remained active and lucid continued his reading writing and correspondences until his death the numerous notes that he made during these years amongst others on aging were published posthumously under the title senilia in the spring of his health started to decline he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations in september he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak his last friend to visit him was wilhelm gwinner and according to him schopenhauer was concerned that he wouldn be able to finish his planned additions to parerga and paralipomena but was at peace with dying he died of pulmonary respiratory failure on september while sitting at home on his couch he was philosophy the world as representation schopenhauer saw his philosophy as continuation of kant and used the results of kantian epistemological investigation transcendental idealism as starting point for his own kant had argued the empirical world is merely complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our mental representations schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work the world is my representation die welt ist meine vorstellung everything there is for cognition the entire world exists simply as an object in relation to subject representation to subject everything that belongs to the world is therefore subject dependent in book one of the world as will and representation schopenhauer considers the world from this angle insofar as it is representation theory of perception in november goethe invited schopenhauer to help him on his theory of colours although schopenhauer considered colour theory minor matter he accepted the invitation out of admiration for goethe nevertheless these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology finding demonstration for the priori nature of causality kant openly admitted that it was hume skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations in critique of pure reason and gave an elaborate proof to show that causality is priori after schulze had made it plausible that kant had not disproven hume skepticism it was up to those loyal to kant project to prove this important matter the difference between the approach of kant and schopenhauer was this kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is given to us from outside an expression with which schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction he on the other hand was occupied with how do we get this empirical content of perception how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations limited to my skin as the objective perception of things that lie outside of me causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality hereby hume skepticism is disproven by this intellectual operation comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause the external world arises with vision finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines we are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object that inverts the impression on the retinas and that uses the change in the apparent position of an object relative to more distant objects provided by binocular vision to perceive depth and distance schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation he set out his theory of perception for the first time in on vision and colors and in the subsequent editions of fourfold root an extensive exposition is given in the world as will in book two of the world as will and representation schopenhauer considers what the world is beyond the aspect of it that appears to us the aspect of the world beyond representation the world considered in itself its inner essence the very being in itself of all things schopenhauer argues is will wille the empirical world that appears to us as representation has plurality and is ordered in spatio temporal framework the world as thing in itself must exist outside the subjective forms of space and time though the world manifests itself to our experience as multiplicity of objects the objectivation of the will each element of this multiplicity has the same blind striving essence towards existence and life human rationality is merely secondary phenomenon that does not distinguish humanity from the rest of nature at the fundamental essential level the advanced cognitive abilities of humans schopenhauer argues serve the ends of willing an illogical directionless ceaseless striving that condemns the human individual to life of suffering unredeemed by any final purpose schopenhauer philosophy of the will as the essential reality behind the world as representation is often called metaphysical voluntarism for schopenhauer understanding the world as will leads to ethical concerns see the ethics section below for further detail which he explores in the fourth book of the world as will and representation and again in his two prize essays on ethics on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality no individual human actions are free schopenhauer argues because they are events in the world of appearance and thus are subject to the principle of sufficient reason person actions are necessary consequence of motives and the given character of the individual human necessity extends to the actions of human beings just as it does to every other appearance and thus we cannot speak of freedom of individual willing albert einstein quoted the schopenhauerian idea that man can do as he will but not will as he will yet the will as thing in itself is free as it exists beyond the realm of representation and thus is not constrained by any of the forms of necessity that are part of the principle of sufficient reason according to schopenhauer salvation from our miserable existence can come through the will being tranquillized by the metaphysical insight that reveals individuality to be merely an illusion the saint or great soul intuitively recognizes the whole comprehends its essence and finds that it is constantly passing away caught up in vain strivings inner conflict and perpetual suffering the negation of the will in other words stems from the insight that the world in itself free from the forms of space and time is one ascetic practices schopenhauer remarks are used to aid the will self abolition which brings about blissful redemptive will less state of emptiness that is free from striving or suffering art and aesthetics dutch golden age artists who directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects and set up lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of still life the aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion for schopenhauer human willing desiring craving etc is at the root of suffering temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation here one moves away from ordinary cognizance of individual things to cognizance of eternal platonic ideas in other words cognizance that is free from the service of will in aesthetic contemplation one no longer perceives an object of perception as something from which one is separated rather it is as if the object alone existed without anyone perceiving it and one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception but the two have become one the entirety of consciousness entirely filled and occupied by single perceptual image subject and object are no longer distinguishable and the idea comes to the fore from this aesthetic immersion one is no longer an individual who suffers as result of servitude to one individual will but rather becomes pure will less painless timeless subject of cognition the pure will less subject of cognition is cognizant only of ideas not individual things this is kind of cognition that is unconcerned with relations between objects according to the principle of sufficient reason time space cause and effect and instead involves complete absorption in the object art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict the essence pure ideas of the world music for schopenhauer was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the principle of sufficient reason therefore as an individual object according to daniel albright schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas but actually embodied the will itself he deemed music timeless universal language comprehended everywhere that can imbue global enthusiasm if in possession of significant melody mathematics schopenhauer realist views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of contemporaneous attempts to prove the parallel postulate in euclidean geometry writing shortly before the discovery of hyperbolic geometry demonstrated the logical independence of the axiom and long before the general theory of relativity revealed that it does not necessarily express property of physical space schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect concepts to prove what he held was directly evident from intuitive perception throughout his writings schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts instead of from intuitive perceptions although schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove euclid parallel postulate he did see reason for examining another of euclid axioms this follows kant reasoning ethics the task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done but to investigate moral actions philosophy is always theoretical its task to explain what is given according to kant transcendental idealism space and time are forms of our sensibility in which phenomena appear in multiplicity reality in itself is free from multiplicity not in the sense that an object is one but that it is outside the possibility of multiplicity two individuals though they appear distinct are in themselves not distinct appearances are entirely subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason the egoistic individual who focuses his aims on his own interests has to deal with empirical laws as well as he can what is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self interest if we take man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty and consequently uses significant part of his income to support their needs instead of his own pleasures then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes less distinction between himself and others than is usually made regarding how things appear to us the egoist asserts gap between two individuals but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own in the same way compassionate man cannot hurt animals though they appear as distinct from himself what motivates the altruist is compassion the suffering of others is for him not cold matter to which he is indifferent but he feels connectiveness to all beings compassion is thus the basis of morality eternal justice schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the principium individuationis when we behold nature we see that it is cruel battle for existence individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others the will as the only thing that exists has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure this is fundamental characteristic of the will and cannot be circumvented unlike temporal or human justice which requires time to repay an evil deed and has its seat in the state as requiting and punishing eternal justice rules not the state but the world is not dependent upon human institutions is not subject to chance and deception is not uncertain wavering and erring but infallible fixed and sure eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time there are no delays or reprieves instead punishment is tied to the offence to the point where the two become one tormenter and tormented are one the tormenter errs in that he believes he is not partaker in the suffering the tormented in that he believes he is not partaker in the guilt suffering is the moral outcome of our attachment to pleasure schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by christian dogma of original sin and in eastern religions the dogma of rebirth quietism he who sees through the principium individuationis and comprehends suffering in general as his own will see suffering everywhere and instead of fighting for the happiness of his individual manifestation will abhor life itself since he knows that it is inseparably connected with suffering for him happy individual life in world of suffering is like beggar who dreams one night that he is king those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge cannot affirm life but exhibit asceticism and quietism meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives are not concerned about their individual welfare and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting they welcome poverty and do not seek or flee death schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live human life is ceaseless struggle for satisfaction and instead of continuing their struggle the ascetic breaks it it does not matter if these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of christianity or dharmic religions since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge psychology philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the necessity of sex but schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly he named force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason the will to live or will to life wille zum leben defined as an inherent drive within human beings and all creatures to stay alive force that inveigles us into reproducing schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man psyche guaranteeing the quality of the human race it has often been argued that schopenhauer thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the theory of evolution claim met with satisfaction by darwin as he included quote of the german philosopher in his descent of man this has also been noted about freud concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind and evolutionary psychology in general political and social thought politics bust in frankfurt am main schopenhauer politics were an echo of his system of ethics which he elucidated in detail in his die beiden grundprobleme der ethik the two essays on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralipomena and manuscript remains schopenhauer described himself as proponent of limited government schopenhauer shared the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and state action to check our species innate destructive tendencies he also defended the independence of the legislative judicial and executive branches of power and monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice in practical and everyday sense not cosmological one he declared that monarchy is natural to man in almost the same way as it is to bees and ants to cranes in flight to wandering elephants to wolves in pack in search of prey and to other animals intellect in monarchies he writes always has much better chances against stupidity its implacable and ever present foe than it has in republics but this is great advantage on the other hand schopenhauer disparaged republicanism as being as unnatural to man as it is unfavorable to higher intellectual life and thus to the arts and sciences schopenhauer by his own admission did not give much thought to politics and several times he wrote proudly of how little attention he paid to political affairs of his day in life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government and few continent shaking wars he did maintain his position of minding not the times but the eternities he wrote many disparaging remarks about germany and the germans typical example is for german it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth for he thinks slowly and they give him time to reflect punishment the state schopenhauer claimed punishes criminals to prevent future crimes it places beside every possible motive for committing wrong more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the inescapable punishment accordingly the criminal code is as complete register as possible of counter motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined he claimed this doctrine was not original to him previously it appeared in the writings of plato seneca hobbes pufendorf and anselm feuerbach races and religions schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern white races due to their sensitivity and creativity except for the ancient egyptians and hindus whom he saw as equal the highest civilization and culture apart from the ancient hindus and egyptians are found exclusively among the white races and even with many dark peoples the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has therefore evidently immigrated for example the brahmans the incas and the rulers of the south sea islands all this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need want and misery which in their many forms were brought about by the climate this they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization schopenhauer was fervently anti slavery speaking of the treatment of slaves in the slave holding states of the united states schopenhauer condemned those devils in human form those bigoted church going strict sabbath observing scoundrels especially the anglican parsons among them for how they treat their innocent black brothers who through violence and injustice have fallen into their devil claws the slave holding states of north america schopenhauer writes are disgrace to the whole of humanity in his metaphysics of sexual love schopenhauer wrote further the consideration as to the complexion is very decided blondes prefer dark persons or brunettes but the latter seldom prefer the former the reason is that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves variation from the type almost an abnormity analogous to white mice or at least to grey horses in no part of the world not even in the vicinity of the pole are they indigenous except in europe and are clearly of scandinavian origin may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man but that by nature he has black or brown skin like our forefathers the hindus that consequently white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature and that thus there is no such thing as white race much as this is talked of but every white man is faded or bleached one forced into the strange world where he only exists like an exotic plant and like this requires in winter the hothouse in the course of thousands of years man became white the gipsies an indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago show the transition from the complexion of the hindu to our own therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type but the white colour of the skin has become second nature though not so that the brown of the hindu repels us finally each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is schopenhauer also maintained marked metaphysical and political anti judaism schopenhauer argued that christianity constituted revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of judaism exhibiting an indian influenced ethics reflecting the aryan vedic theme of spiritual self conquest he saw this as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of worldly jewish spirit judaism is therefore the crudest and poorest of all religions and consists merely in an absurd and revolting theism it amounts to this that the kyrios κύριος lord who has created the world desires to be worshipped and adored and so above all he is jealous is envious of his colleagues of all the other gods if sacrifices are made to them he is furious and his jews have bad time it is most deplorable that this religion has become the basis of the prevailing religion of europe for it is religion without any metaphysical tendency while all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life the religion of the jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but mere war cry in the struggle with other nations women in his essay on women schopenhauer expressed opposition to what he called teutonico christian stupidity of reflexive unexamined reverence abgeschmackten for the female schopenhauer wrote women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish frivolous and short sighted he opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice and expressed his opposition to monogamy rodgers and thompson in philosophers behaving badly call schopenhauer misogynist without rival in western philosophy he claimed that woman is by nature meant to obey the essay does give some compliments however women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others schopenhauer writings influenced many from friedrich nietzsche to nineteenth century feminists his biological analysis of the difference between the sexes and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists when the elderly schopenhauer sat for sculpture portrait by the prussian sculptor elisabet ney in he was much impressed by the young woman wit and independence as well as by her skill as visual artist after his time with ney he told richard wagner friend malwida von meysenbug have not yet spoken my last word about women believe that if woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass or rather raising herself above the mass she grows ceaselessly and more than man pederasty in the third expanded edition of the world as will and representation schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love he wrote that pederasty has the benefit of preventing ill begotten children concerning this he stated that the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature and that in matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims although only indirectly as means for preventing greater evils schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that by expounding these paradoxical ideas wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy small favour have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that defend and commend pederasty heredity and eugenics schopenhauer at age on may schopenhauer viewed personality and intellect as inherited he quotes horace saying from the brave and good are the brave descended odes iv and shakespeare line from cymbeline cowards father cowards and base things sire base iv to reinforce his hereditarian argument mechanistically schopenhauer believed that person inherits his intellect through his mother and personal character through the father this belief in heritability of traits informed schopenhauer view of love placing it at the highest level of importance for schopenhauer the final aim of all love intrigues be they comic or tragic is really of more importance than all other ends in human life what it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation it is not the weal or woe of any one individual but that of the human race to come which is here at stake this view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding here schopenhauer wrote with our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties we are led to the view that real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation plato had something of the kind in mind when in the fifth book of his republic he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste if we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in convent and give men of noble character whole harem and procure men and indeed thorough men for all girls of intellect and understanding then generation would soon arise which would produce better age than that of pericles in another context schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis if you want utopian plans would say the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members of genuine aristocracy genuine nobility achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women this proposal constitutes my utopia and my platonic republic analysts keith ansell pearson have suggested that schopenhauer anti egalitarianist sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neo aristocratic philosophy of friedrich nietzsche who initially considered schopenhauer his mentor animal welfare as consequence of his monistic philosophy schopenhauer was very concerned about animal welfare for him all individual animals including humans are essentially phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying will the word will designated for him force power impulse energy and desire it is the closest word we have that can signify both the essence of all external things and our own direct inner experience since every living thing possesses will humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other for this reason he claimed that good person would have sympathy for animals who are our fellow sufferers in he praised the establishment in london of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and the animals friends society in philadelphia schopenhauer went so far as to protest using the pronoun it in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things to reinforce his points schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of monkey who had been shot and also the grief of baby elephant whose mother had been killed by hunter he was very attached to his succession of pet poodles schopenhauer criticized spinoza belief that animals are mere means for the satisfaction of humans intellectual interests and affinities indology photo of schopenhauer schopenhauer read the latin translation of the ancient hindu texts the upanishads translated by french writer anquetil du perron from the persian translation of prince dara shukoh entitled sirre akbar the great secret he was so impressed by philosophy that he called it the production of the highest human wisdom and believed it contained superhuman concepts schopenhauer considered india as the land of the most ancient and most pristine wisdom the place from which europeans could trace their descent and the tradition by which they had been influenced in so many decisive ways and regarded the upanishads as the most profitable and elevating reading which is possible in the world it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death schopenhauer was first introduced to anquetil du perron translation by friedrich majer in they met during the winter of in weimar at the home of schopenhauer mother according to the biographer safranski majer was follower of herder and an early indologist schopenhauer did not begin serious study of the indic texts however until the summer of safranski maintains that between and schopenhauer had another important cross pollination with indian thought in dresden this was through his neighbor of two years karl christian friedrich krause krause was then minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with ancient indian wisdom krause had also mastered sanskrit unlike schopenhauer and they developed professional relationship it was from krause that schopenhauer learned meditation and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning indian thought the book oupnekhat upanishad always lay open on his table and he invariably studied it before going to bed he called the opening up of sanskrit literature the greatest gift of our century and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the upanishads would become the cherished faith of the west most noticeable in the case of schopenhauer work was the significance of the chandogya upanishad whose mahāvākya tat tvam asi is mentioned throughout the world as will and representation buddhism schopenhauer noted correspondence between his doctrines and the four noble truths of buddhism similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering that suffering is caused by desire taṇhā and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation thus three of the four truths of the buddha correspond to schopenhauer doctrine of the will in buddhism however while greed and lust are always unskillful desire is ethically variable it can be skillful unskillful or neutral for schopenhauer will had ontological primacy over the intellect desire is prior to thought schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of puruṣārtha or goals of life in vedānta hinduism in schopenhauer philosophy denial of the will is attained by personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live or knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people however buddhist nirvāṇa is not equivalent to the condition that schopenhauer described as denial of the will nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the person as some western scholars have thought but only the extinguishing the literal meaning of nirvana of the flames of greed hatred and delusion that assail person character schopenhauer made the following statement in his discussion of religions if wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth should have to concede to buddhism pre eminence over the others in any case it must be pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own for this numbers far more followers than any other and this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me inasmuch as in my philosophizing have certainly not been under its influence emphasis added for up till when my work appeared there was to be found in europe only very few accounts of buddhism buddhist philosopher nishitani keiji however sought to distance buddhism from schopenhauer while schopenhauer philosophy may sound rather mystical in such summary his methodology was resolutely empirical rather than speculative or transcendental philosophy is science and as such has no articles of faith accordingly in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions also note this actual world of what is knowable in which we are and which is in us remains both the material and the limit of our consideration the argument that buddhism affected schopenhauer philosophy more than any other dharmic faith loses credence since he did not begin serious study of buddhism until after the publication of the world as will and representation in scholars have started to revise earlier views about schopenhauer discovery of buddhism proof of early interest and influence however appears in schopenhauer notes transcribed and translated by urs app about buddhism they are included in recent case study that traces schopenhauer interest in buddhism and documents its influence other scholarly work questions how similar schopenhauer philosophy actually is to buddhism magic and occultism some traditions in western esotericism and parapsychology interested schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories he praised animal magnetism as evidence for the reality of magic in his on the will in nature and went so far as to accept the division of magic into left hand and right hand magic although he doubted the existence of demons schopenhauer grounded magic in the will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human will not on ritual this theory notably parallels aleister crowley system of magick and its emphasis on human will given the importance of the will to schopenhauer overarching system this amounts to suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers schopenhauer rejected the theory of disenchantment and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic which he believed amount to practical metaphysics neoplatonism including the traditions of plotinus and to lesser extent marsilio ficino has also been cited as an influence on schopenhauer interests schopenhauer had wide range of interests from science and opera to occultism and literature in his student years schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy he kept strong interest as his personal library contained near to books of scientific literature at his death and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library many evenings were spent in the theatre opera and ballet schopenhauer especially liked the operas of mozart rossini and bellini schopenhauer considered music the highest art and played the flute during his whole life as polyglot he knew german italian spanish french english latin and ancient greek and was an avid reader of poetry and literature he particularly revered goethe petrarch calderón and shakespeare if goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with kant in order to counterbalance him so to speak in the spirit of the age the latter would have been haunted like nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction but now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the german spirit to height surpassing even that of antiquity in philosophy his most important influences were according to himself kant plato and the upanishads concerning the upanishads and vedas he writes in the world as will and representation if the reader has also received the benefit of the vedas the access to which by means of the upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century may claim before all previous centuries if then the reader say has received his initiation in primeval indian wisdom and received it with an open heart he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what have to tell him it will not sound to him strange as to many others much less disagreeable for might if it did not sound conceited contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the upanishads may be deduced as necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which have to enunciate though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there thoughts on other philosophers giordano bruno and spinoza schopenhauer saw bruno and spinoza as philosophers not bound to their age or nation both were fulfilled by the thought that as manifold the appearances of the world may be it is still one being that appears in all of them consequently there is no place for god as creator of the world in their philosophy but god is the world itself schopenhauer expressed regret that spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of scholasticism and cartesian philosophy and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of vague and overly broad definitions bruno on the other hand who knew much about nature and ancient literature presented his ideas with italian vividness and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near plato poetic and dramatic power of exposition schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics and it is therefore very remarkable that spinoza called his main work ethics in fact it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life affirmation if one completely ignores morality and self denial it is yet even more remarkable that schopenhauer mentions spinoza as an example of the denial of the will if one uses the french biography by jean maximilien lucas as the key to tractatus de intellectus emendatione immanuel kant schopenhauer philosophy took kant work as its foundation while he praised kant greatness he nonetheless included highly detailed criticism of kantian philosophy as an appendix to the world as will and representation the importance of kant for schopenhauer in philosophy as well as on personal level cannot be overstated kant philosophy was the foundation of schopenhauer and he had high praise for the transcendental aesthetic section of kant critique of pure reason schopenhauer maintained that kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as berkeley and plato as copernicus to hicetas philolaus and aristarchus kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted schopenhauer writes about kant influence on his work in the preface to the second edition of the world as will and representation in his study room one bust was of buddha the other was of kant the bond which schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of königsberg is demonstrated in an unfinished poem he dedicated to kant included in volume of the parerga schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work the world as will and representation to detailed criticism of the kantian philosophy schopenhauer praised kant for his distinction between appearance and the thing in itself whereas the general consensus in german idealism was that this was the weakest spot of kant theory since according to kant causality can find application on objects of experience only and consequently things in themselves cannot be the cause of appearances the inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by schopenhauer he insisted that this was true conclusion drawn from false premises post kantian school the leading figures of post kantian philosophy johann gottlieb fichte schelling and hegel were not respected by schopenhauer he argued that they were not philosophers at all for they lacked the first requirement of philosopher namely seriousness and honesty of inquiry rather they were merely sophists who excelling in the art of beguiling the public pursued their own selfish interests such as professional advancement within the university system diatribes against the vacuity dishonesty pomposity and self interest of these contemporaries are to be found throughout schopenhauer published writings the following passage is an example schopenhauer deemed schelling the most talented of the three and wrote that he would recommend his elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of kant concerning the intelligible character if he had been honest enough to admit he was parroting kant instead of hiding this relation in cunning manner schopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for hegel whom he considered less worthy than fichte or schelling whereas fichte was merely windbag windbeutel hegel was commonplace inane loathsome repulsive and ignorant charlatan the philosophers karl popper and mario bunge agreed with this distinction hegel schopenhauer wrote in the preface to his two fundamental problems of ethics not only performed no service to philosophy but he has had detrimental influence on philosophy and thereby on german literature in general really downright stupefying or we could even say pestilential influence which it is therefore the duty of everyone capable of thinking for himself and judging for himself to counteract in the most express terms at every opportunity influence sculpture of schopenhauer by elisabeth ney schopenhauer remained the most influential german philosopher until the first world war his philosophy was starting point for new generation of philosophers including julius bahnsen paul deussen lazar von hellenbach karl robert eduard von hartmann ernst otto lindner philipp mainländer friedrich nietzsche olga plümacher and agnes taubert his legacy shaped the intellectual debate and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him neo kantianism and positivism to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored and in doing so he changed them markedly the french writer maupassant commented that to day even those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought other philosophers of the th century who cited his influence include hans vaihinger volkelt solovyov and weininger schopenhauer was well read by physicists most notably einstein schrödinger wolfgang pauli and majorana einstein described schopenhauer thoughts as continual consolation and called him genius in his berlin study three figures hung on the wall faraday maxwell schopenhauer konrad wachsmann recalled he often sat with one of the well worn schopenhauer volumes and as he sat there he seemed so pleased as if he were engaged with serene and cheerful work when erwin schrödinger discovered schopenhauer the greatest savant of the west he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy he maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life wolfgang pauli accepted the main tenet of schopenhauer metaphysics that the thing in itself is will but most of all schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists richard wagner became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the schopenhauerian philosophy the admiration was not mutual and schopenhauer proclaimed remain faithful to rossini and mozart so he has been nicknamed the artist philosopher see also influence of schopenhauer on tristan und isolde under the influence of schopenhauer leo tolstoy became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self renunciation when he read schopenhauer philosophy tolstoy exclaimed at present am convinced that schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men it is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection he said that what he has written in war and peace is also said by schopenhauer in the world as will and representation jorge luis borges remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write systematic account of his world view despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular was because schopenhauer had already written it for him other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by schopenhauer were thomas mann thomas hardy afanasy fet huysmans and george santayana in herman melville final years while he wrote billy budd he read schopenhauer essays and marked them heavily scholar brian yothers notes that melville marked numerous misanthropic and even suicidal remarks suggesting an attraction to the most extreme sorts of solitude but he also made note of schopenhauer reflection on the moral ambiguities of genius schopenhauer attraction to and discussions of both eastern and western religions in conjunction with each other made an impression on melville in his final years sergei prokofiev although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism became fascinated with schopenhauer after reading aphorisms on the wisdom of life in parerga and paralipomena with his truths schopenhauer gave me spiritual world and an awareness of happiness friedrich nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading the world as will and representation and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected dedicating to him his essay schopenhauer als erzieher one of his untimely meditations commemorative stamp of the deutsche bundespost early in his career ludwig wittgenstein adopted schopenhauer epistemological idealism and some traits of schopenhauer influence particularly schopenhauerian can be observed in the tractatus logico philosophicus however later on wittgenstein rejected epistemological transcendental idealism for gottlob frege conceptual realism in later years wittgenstein became highly dismissive of schopenhauer describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker his friend bertrand russell had low opinion on the philosopher and attacked him in his history of western philosophy for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it opposite to russell on the foundations of mathematics the dutch mathematician brouwer incorporated kant and schopenhauer ideas in intuitionism where mathematics is considered purely mental activity instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed brouwer was also influenced by schopenhauer metaphysics and wrote an essay on mysticism schopenhauer philosophy has

angola officially the republic of angola is country on the west coast of southern africa it is the second largest lusophone portuguese speaking country in both total area and population behind brazil and it is the seventh largest country in africa bordered by namibia to the south the democratic republic of the congo to the north zambia to the east and the atlantic ocean to the west angola has an exclave province the province of cabinda that borders the republic of the congo and the democratic republic of the congo the capital and largest city of angola is luanda the territory of angola has been inhabited since the paleolithic era hosting wide variety of ethnic groups tribes and kingdoms the nation state of angola originated from portuguese colonisation which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the th century in the th century european settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior the portuguese colony that became angola did not have its present borders until the early th century because of resistance by groups such as the cuamato the kwanyama and the mbunda after protracted anti colonial struggle independence was achieved in as the marxist leninist people republic of angola one party state supported by the soviet union and cuba the civil war between the ruling people movement for the liberation of angola mpla and the insurgent anti communist national union for the total independence of angola unita supported by the united states and south africa lasted until the sovereign state has since become relatively stable unitary presidential constitutional republic angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves and its economy is among the fastest growing in the world especially since the end of the civil war however the standard of living remains low for most of the population and life expectancy in angola is among the lowest in the world while infant mortality is among the highest angola economic growth is highly uneven with most of the nation wealth concentrated in small sector of the population angola is member state of the united nations opec african union the community of portuguese language countries and the southern african development community highly multiethnic country angola million people span tribal groups customs and traditions angolan culture reflects centuries of portuguese rule in the predominance of the portuguese language and of the catholic church etymology the name angola comes from the portuguese colonial name kingdom of angola which appeared as early as paulo dias de novais charter the toponym was derived by the portuguese from the title held by the kings of ndongo ndongo in the highlands between the kwanza and lucala rivers was nominally possession of the kingdom of kongo but was seeking greater independence in the th century history early migrations and political units king joão manikongo of the kingdom of kongo modern angola was populated predominantly by nomadic khoi and san prior to the first bantu migrations the khoi and san peoples were neither pastoralists nor cultivators but rather hunter gatherers they were displaced by bantu peoples arriving from the north in the first millennium bc most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern nigeria and southern niger bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro as well as large cattle herds to angola central highlands and the luanda plain number of political entities were established the best known of these was the kingdom of the kongo based in angola which extended northward to what is now the democratic republic of the congo the republic of the congo and gabon it established trade routes with other city states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western africa and even with great zimbabwe and the mutapa empire although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade to its south lay the kingdom of ndongo from which the area of the later portuguese colony was sometimes known as dongo portuguese colonization coat of arms granted to king afonso of kongo by king manuel of portugal portuguese explorer diogo cão reached the area in the previous year the portuguese had established relations with the kongo which stretched at the time from modern gabon in the north to the kwanza river in the south the portuguese established their primary early trading post at soyo which is now the northernmost city in angola apart from the cabinda exclave paulo dias de novais founded são paulo de loanda luanda in with hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers benguela was fortified in and became township in the portuguese established several other settlements forts and trading posts along the angolan coast principally trading in angolan slaves for plantations local slave dealers provided large number of slaves for the portuguese empire usually in exchange for manufactured goods from europe this part of the atlantic slave trade continued until after brazil independence in the queen ana de sousa of ndongo meeting with the portuguese depiction of luanda from despite portugal territorial claims in angola its control over much of the country vast interior was minimal in the th century portugal gained control of the coast through series of treaties and wars life for european colonists was difficult and progress slow john iliffe notes that portuguese records of angola from the th century show that great famine occurred on average every seventy years accompanied by epidemic disease it might kill one third or one half of the population destroying the demographic growth of generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys during the portuguese restoration war the dutch west india company occupied the principal settlement of luanda in using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against portuguese holdings elsewhere fleet under salvador de sá retook luanda in reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by new treaties with the kongo were signed in others with njinga kingdom of matamba and ndongo followed in the conquest of pungo andongo in was the last major portuguese expansion from luanda as attempts to invade kongo in and matamba in failed colonial outposts also expanded inward from benguela but until the late th century the inroads from luanda and benguela were very limited hamstrung by series of political upheavals in the early portugal was slow to mount large scale annexation of angolan territory history of angola written in luanda in the slave trade was abolished in angola in and in the colonial government freed all its existing slaves four years later more progressive administration appointed by lisbon abolished slavery altogether however these decrees remained largely unenforceable and the portuguese depended on assistance from the british royal navy to enforce their ban on the slave trade this coincided with series of renewed military expeditions into the bush by the mid nineteenth century portugal had established its dominion as far east as the congo river and as far south as mossâmedes until the late lisbon entertained proposals to link angola with its colony in mozambique but was blocked by british and belgian opposition in this period the portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in angola the berlin conference in set the colony borders delineating the boundaries of portuguese claims in angola although many details were unresolved until the trade between portugal and its african territories rapidly increased as result of protective tariffs leading to increased development and wave of new portuguese immigrants angolan independence portuguese armed forces marching in luanda during the portuguese colonial wars under colonial law black angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions the first nationalist movements did not take root until after world war ii spearheaded by largely westernised portuguese speaking urban class which included many mestiços during the early they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce portugal refusal to address increasing angolan demands for self determination provoked an armed conflict which erupted in with the baixa de cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years throughout the conflict three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the portuguese government and local forces supported to varying degrees by the portuguese communist party the national front for the liberation of angola fnla recruited from bakongo refugees in zaire benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in léopoldville and especially from common border with zaire angolan political exiles were able to build up power base among large expatriate community from related families clans and traditions people on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical kingdom of kongo though as foreigners skilled angolans could not take advantage of mobutu sese seko state employment programme some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures the migrants eventually formed the fnla with the intention of making bid for political power upon their envisaged return to angola members of the national liberation front of angola training in largely ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the portuguese in central angola from was spearheaded by jonas savimbi and the national union for the total independence of angola unita it remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders the ethnic fragmentation of the ovimbundu and the isolation of peasants on european plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise during the late the rise of the marxist leninist popular movement for the liberation of angola mpla in the east and dembos hills north of luanda came to hold special significance formed as coalition resistance movement by the angolan communist party the organisation leadership remained predominantly ambundu and courted public sector workers in luanda although both the mpla and its rivals accepted material assistance from the soviet union or the people republic of china the former harboured strong anti imperialist views and was openly critical of the united states and its support for portugal this allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front soliciting support from nonaligned governments in morocco ghana guinea mali and the united arab republic the mpla attempted to move its headquarters from conakry to léopoldville in october renewing efforts to create common front with the fnla then known as the union of angolan peoples upa and its leader holden roberto roberto turned down the offer when the mpla first attempted to insert its own insurgents into angola the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by upa partisans on roberto orders setting precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the angolan civil war angolan civil war agostinho neto first president of angola throughout the war of independence the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the portuguese between and the mpla unita and the fnla competed for influence in the angolan population and the international community the soviet union and cuba became especially sympathetic towards the mpla and supplied that party with arms ammunition funding and training they also backed unita militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the mpla the collapse of portugal estado novo government following the carnation revolution suspended all portuguese military activity in africa and the brokering of ceasefire pending negotiations for angolan independence encouraged by the organisation of african unity holden roberto jonas savimbi and mpla chairman agostinho neto met in mombasa in early january and agreed to form coalition government this was ratified by the alvor agreement later that month which called for general elections and set the country independence date for november all three factions however followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual portuguese withdrawal to seize various strategic positions acquire more arms and enlarge their militant forces the rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources especially the soviet union and the united states as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties fueled new outbreak of hostilities with tacit american and zairean support the fnla began massing large numbers of troops in northern angola in an attempt to gain military superiority meanwhile the mpla began securing control of luanda traditional ambundu stronghold sporadic violence broke out in luanda over the next few months after the fnla attacked mpla forces in march the fighting intensified with street clashes in april and may and unita became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an mpla contingent that june an upswing in soviet arms shipments to the mpla influenced decision by the central intelligence agency to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the fnla and unita maximum extent of unita and south african operations in angola and zambia during the angolan civil war in august the mpla requested direct assistance from the soviet union in the form of ground troops the soviets declined offering to send advisers but no troops however cuba was more forthcoming and in late september dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to angola along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies by independence there were over thousand cuban soldiers in the country they were kept supplied by massive airbridge carried out with soviet aircraft the persistent buildup of cuban and soviet military aid allowed the mpla to drive its opponents from luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by zairean and south african troops which had deployed in belated attempt to assist the fnla and unita the fnla was largely annihilated although unita managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces from there savimbi continued to mount determined insurgent campaign against the mpla cuban tank in luanda during the cuban intervention in angola between and the mpla implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of scientific socialism incorporating central planning and marxist leninist one party state it embarked on an ambitious programme of nationalisation and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished privately owned enterprises were nationalised and incorporated into single umbrella of state owned enterprises known as unidades economicas estatais uee under the mpla angola experienced significant degree of modern however corruption and graft also increased and public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment the ruling party survived an attempted coup état by the maoist oriented communist organisation of angola oca in which was suppressed after series of bloody political purges left thousands of oca supporters dead the mpla abandoned its former marxist ideology at its third party congress in and declared social democracy to be its new platform angola subsequently became member of the international monetary fund restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment by may it reached peace agreement with unita the bicesse accords which scheduled new general elections for september when the mpla secured major electoral victory unita objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war following the election the halloween massacre occurred from october to november where mpla forces killed thousands of unita supporters st century luanda is experiencing widespread urban renewal and redevelopment in the st century backed largely by profits from oil diamond industries on march jonas savimbi was killed in action against government troops unita and the mpla reached cease fire shortly afterwards unita gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party although the political situation of the country began to stabilise regular democratic processes did not prevail until the elections in angola in and and the adoption of new constitution in all of which strengthened the prevailing dominant party system angola has serious humanitarian crisis the result of

also prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation the vote was overwhelming for against abstaining economy port of luanda is one of the busiest ports in africa headquarters of sonangol high rises in downtown luanda angola has diamonds oil gold copper and rich wildlife dramatically impoverished during the civil war forest and fossil fuels since independence oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource smallholder and plantation agriculture dramatically dropped in the angolan civil war but began to recover after the transformation industry of the late colonial period collapsed at independence because of the exodus of most of the ethnic portuguese population but it has begun to re emerge with updated technologies partly because of an influx of new portuguese entrepreneurs similar developments have taken place in the service sector angola economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by quarter century of angolan civil war to become the fastest growing economy in africa and one of the fastest growing in the world with an average gdp growth of between and in the period angola had the world highest annual average gdp growth at in the exim bank of china approved billion line of credit to angola to be used for rebuilding angola infrastructure and to limit the influence of the international monetary fund there china is angola biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth largest source of imports bilateral trade reached billion in up year on year china imports mainly crude oil and diamonds increased to billion while china exports to angola including mechanical and electrical products machinery parts and construction materials surged the oil glut led to local price for unleaded gasoline of gallon the angolan economy grew in in and in due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated in the security brought about by the peace settlement has allowed the resettlement of million displaced persons and resulting large scale increases in agriculture production angola economy is expected to grow by percent in said the international monetary fund imf robust growth in the non oil economy mainly driven by very good performance in the agricultural sector is expected to offset temporary drop in oil production the national bank of angola angola financial system is maintained by the national bank of angola and managed by governor jose de lima massano according to study on the banking sector carried out by deloitte the monetary policy led by banco nacional de angola bna the angolan national bank allowed decrease in the inflation rate put at in december which contributed to the sector growth trend estimates released by angola central bank said country economy should grow at an annual average rate of percent over the next four years boosted by the increasing participation of the private sector although the country economy has grown significantly since angola achieved political stability in mainly due to fast rising earnings in the oil sector angola faces huge social and economic problems these are in part result of almost continual armed conflict from on although the highest level of destruction and socio economic damage took place after the independence during the long years of civil war however high poverty rates and blatant social inequality chiefly stem from persistent neo patrimonial practices at all levels of the political administrative military and economic structures and of pervasive corruption the main beneficiaries are political administrative economic and military power holders who have accumulated and continue to accumulate enormous wealth luanda financial city secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata which are about to become social classes however almost half the population has to be considered poor with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities where by now slightly more than of the people live study carried out in by the angolan instituto nacional de estatística found that in rural areas roughly must be classified as poor according to un norms but in the urban areas only and an overall rate of in cities majority of families well beyond those officially classified as poor must adopt variety of survival strategies in urban areas social inequality is most evident and it is extreme in luanda in the human development index angola constantly ranks in the bottom group tourism in angola has grown with the country economy and stability in january leak of government documents known as the luanda leaks showed that consulting companies such as boston consulting group mckinsey company and had helped members of the family of former president josé eduardo dos santos especially his daughter isabel dos santos corruptly run sonangol for their own personal profit helping them use the company revenues to fund vanity projects in france and switzerland the enormous differences between the regions pose serious structural problem for the angolan economy illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in luanda and neighbouring bengo province while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression one of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is sharp increase in angolan private investments abroad the small fringe of angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets for reasons of security and profit for the time being the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in portugal where the angolan presence including the family of the state president in banks as well as in the domains of energy and mass media has become notable as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises corporate headquarters in luanda angola has upgraded critical infrastructure an investment made possible by funds from the nation development of oil resources according to report just slightly more than ten years after the end of the civil war angola standard of living has overall greatly improved life expectancy which was just years in

admitted as member of opec according to the heritage foundation conservative american think tank oil production from angola has increased so significantly that angola now is china biggest supplier of oil china has extended three multibillion dollar lines of credit to the angolan government two loans of billion from china exim bank one in the second in as well as one loan in of billion from china international fund ltd growing oil revenues also created opportunities for corruption according to recent human rights watch report billion us dollars disappeared from government accounts in furthermore sonangol the state run oil company controls of cabinda oil due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit received by the government and the taxes it pays the council of foreign affairs states that the world bank mentioned that sonangol is taxpayer it carries out quasi fiscal activities it invests public funds and as concessionaire it is sector regulator this multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises complex relationship between sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state in angola demanded compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by chevron corporation the first time it had fined multinational corporation operating in its waters operations in its diamond mines include partnerships between state run endiama and mining companies such as alrosa which operate in angola access to biocapacity in

warning markers by the side of the road the angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country roads the road between lubango and namibe for example was completed recently with

despite extensive oil and gas resources diamonds hydroelectric potential and rich agricultural land angola remains poor and third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture since when the year civil war ended government policy prioritized the repair and improvement of infrastructure and strengthening of political and social institutions during the first decade of the st century angola was one of the fastest growing in the world with reported annual average gdp growth of percent from to high international oil prices and rising oil production contributed to strong economic growth although with high inequality at that time corruption is rife throughout the economy and the country remains heavily dependent on the oil sector which in accounted for over percent of exports by value and percent of government revenue with the end of the oil boom from angola entered into period of economic contraction history the portuguese explorer diogo cão reached the angolan coast in after which portugal began to found trading posts and forts along the shore paulo dias de novais founded sāo paulo de loanda luanda in são felipe de benguella benguela followed in the principal early trade was in slaves portuguese merchants purchased the slaves from the local imbangala and mbundu peoples notable slave hunters and sold them to the sugarcane plantations in brazil brazilian ships were frequent visitors to luanda and benguela and angola functioned as kind of colony of brazil with brazilian jesuits active in its religious and educational centers the portuguese empire was neglected during the period of the iberian union which lasted from to the dutch bitter enemies of their former masters in spain invaded many portuguese overseas possessions during portugal separatist war against spain the dutch occupied luanda from to calling it fort aardenburgh the dutch used the territory to supply their own slaves to the sugarcane plantations of northeastern brazil pernambuco olinda recife which they had also seized from portugal john maurice prince of nassau siegen conquered the portuguese possessions of saint george del mina saint thomas and luanda angola on the west coast of africa portugal recovered the territory between and in the high plains the planalto the most important native states were bié and bailundo the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber portugal expanded into their territory but did not control much of the interior prior to the late th century the portuguese started to develop townships trading posts logging camps and small processing factories from onwards there was gradual change from slave based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export following the independence of brazil in the slave trade was formally abolished in however it did continue locally into the th century in angola ports were opened to foreign shipping by luanda was one of the greatest and most developed portuguese cities in the vast portuguese empire outside of mainland portugal full of trading companies exporting peanut oil copal timber and cocoa the principal exports of the post slave economy in the th century were rubber beeswax and ivory maize tobacco dried meat and cassava flour also began to be locally produced prior to the first world war exportation of coffee palm kernels and oil cattle leather and hides and salt fish joined the principal exports with small quantities of gold and cotton also being produced grains sugar and rum were also produced for local consumption the principal imports were foodstuffs cotton goods hardware and british coal legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the the territory prosperity however continued to depend on plantations worked by labor indentured from the interior from the to the strong economic growth abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure led to the arrival of even more portuguese settlers petroleum was

southwestern deserts to texas crossing the colorado river into the confederate territory of arizona on july his escort was commanded by alonzo ridley undersheriff of los angeles who remained at johnston side until he was killed early in the civil war confederate president jefferson davis decided that the confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts in the summer of davis appointed several generals to defend confederate lines from the mississippi river east to the allegheny mountains the most sensitive and in many ways the most crucial areas along the mississippi river and in western tennessee along the tennessee and the cumberland rivers were placed under the command of maj gen leonidas polk and brig gen gideon pillow the latter had initially been in command in tennessee as that state top general their impolitic occupation of columbus kentucky on september two days before johnston arrived in the confederacy capital of richmond virginia after his cross country journey drove kentucky from its stated neutrality the majority of kentuckians allied with the union camp polk and pillow action gave union brig gen ulysses grant an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of paducah kentucky without raising the ire of most kentuckians and the pro union majority in the state legislature confederate command in western theater on september johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the confederacy west of the allegheny mountains except for coastal areas he became commander of the confederacy western armies in the area often called the western department or western military department johnston appointment as full general by his friend and admirer jefferson davis already had been confirmed by the confederate senate on august the appointment had been backdated to rank from may making him the second highest ranking general in the confederate states army only adjutant general and inspector general samuel cooper ranked ahead of him after his appointment johnston immediately headed for his new territory he was permitted to call on governors of arkansas tennessee and mississippi for new troops although this authority was largely stifled by politics especially with respect to mississippi on september johnston ordered brig gen felix zollicoffer with men to occupy cumberland gap in kentucky in order to block union troops from coming into eastern tennessee the kentucky legislature had voted to side with the union after the occupation of columbus by polk by september johnston had brig gen simon bolivar buckner with another men blocking the railroad route to tennessee at bowling green kentucky johnston had fewer than men spread throughout kentucky tennessee arkansas and missouri of these were in missouri under missouri state guard maj gen sterling price johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had as the confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the east they gave johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did strategy that worked for several months johnston tactics had so annoyed and confused union brig gen william tecumseh sherman in kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable sherman overestimated johnston forces and had to be relieved by brig gen don carlos buell on november however in his memoirs sherman strongly refutes this account battle of mill springs east tennessee heavily pro union region of the south during the civil war was held for the confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by jefferson davis felix zollicoffer brave but untrained and inexperienced officer and soon to be maj gen george crittenden former army officer with apparent alcohol problems while crittenden was away in richmond zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper cumberland river near mill springs now nancy kentucky putting the river to his back and his forces into trap zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of union troops when union brig gen george thomas moved against the confederates crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of thomas command at logan cross roads near mill springs before the union forces could unite at the battle of mill springs on january the ill prepared confederates after night march in the rain attacked the union force with some initial success as the battle progressed zollicoffer was killed crittenden was unable to lead the confederate force he may have been intoxicated and the confederates were turned back and routed by union bayonet charge suffering casualties from their force of the confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as general crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct after the confederate defeat at the mill springs davis sent johnston brigade and few other scattered reinforcements he also assigned him gen beauregard who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war and act as competent subordinate for johnston the brigade was led by brig gen john floyd considered incompetent he took command at fort donelson as the senior general present just before union brig gen ulysses grant attacked the fort historians believe the assignment of beauregard to the west stimulated union commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make difference in the theater union officers heard that he was bringing regiments with him but this was an exaggeration of his forces fort henry fort donelson nashville based on the assumption that kentucky neutrality would act as shield against direct invasion from the north circumstances that no longer applied in september tennessee initially had sent men to virginia and concentrated defenses in the mississippi valley even before johnston arrived in tennessee construction of two forts had been started to defend the tennessee and the cumberland rivers which provided avenues into the state from the north both forts were located in tennessee in order to respect kentucky neutrality but these were not in ideal locations fort henry on the tennessee river was in an unfavorable low lying location commanded by hills on the kentucky side of the river fort donelson on the cumberland river although in better location had vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats maj gen polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command after johnston took command polk at first refused to comply with johnston order to send an engineer lt joseph dixon to inspect the forts after johnston asserted his authority polk had to allow dixon to proceed dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened although they were not in ideal locations because much work had been done on them and the confederates might not have time to build new ones johnston accepted his recommendations johnston wanted major alexander stewart to command the forts but president davis appointed brig gen lloyd tilghman as commander to prevent polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join partisan group johnston ordered him to send brig gen gideon pillow and men to fort donelson pillow took up position at nearby clarksville tennessee and did not move into the fort until february alerted by union reconnaissance on january johnston ordered tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite fort henry which polk had failed to do despite johnston orders tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out gen beauregard arrived at johnston headquarters at bowling green on february and was given overall command of polk force at the western end of johnston line at columbus kentucky on february union navy gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill sited fort henry inflicting casualties on the small remaining confederate force brig gen lloyd tilghman surrendered the remaining officers and men of his approximately man force which had not been sent to fort donelson before grant force could even take up their positions johnston knew he could be trapped at bowling green if fort donelson fell so he moved his force to nashville the capital of tennessee and an increasingly important confederate industrial center beginning on february johnston also reinforced fort donelson with more men including those under floyd and pillow curious decision in view of his thought that the union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort he did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held the senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison gideon pillow and john floyd squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on february brig gen simon buckner having been abandoned by floyd and pillow surrendered fort donelson colonel nathan bedford forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about men before the surrender the confederates suffered about casualties with an estimated to taken prisoner union casualties were killed wounded missing johnston who had little choice in allowing floyd and pillow to take charge at fort donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the confederate position his passive defensive performance while positioning himself in forward position at bowling green spreading his forces too thinly not concentrating his forces in the face of union advances and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians the fall of the forts exposed nashville to imminent attack and it fell without resistance to union forces under brig gen buell on february two days after johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well concentration at corinth johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command the army of central kentucky from the vicinity of nashville with beauregard help johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregard command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of corinth mississippi which he reached by circuitous route johnston kept the union forces now under the overall command of the ponderous maj gen henry halleck confused and hesitant to move allowing johnston to reach his objective undetected this delay allowed jefferson davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general braxton bragg to help organize the western forces bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before johnston arrival on march johnston army of men gave the confederates combined force of about to men at corinth on march johnston officially took command of this combined force which continued to use the army of the mississippi name under which it had been organized by beauregard on march johnston now planned to defeat the union forces piecemeal before the various union units in kentucky and tennessee under grant with men at nearby pittsburg landing tennessee and the now maj gen don carlos buell on his way from nashville with men could unite against him johnston started his army in motion on april intent on surprising grant force as soon as the next day but they moved slowly due to their inexperience bad roads and lack of adequate staff planning due to the delays as well as several contacts with the enemy johnston second in command beauregard felt the element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off the attack johnston decided to proceed as planned stating would fight them if they were million his army was finally in position within mile or two of grant force and undetected by the evening of april battle of shiloh and death monument to johnston at shiloh national military park johnston launched massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against grant at the battle of shiloh on april as the confederate forces overran the union camps johnston seemed to be everywhere personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse one of his most famous moments in the battle occurred when he witnessed some of his soldiers breaking from the ranks to pillage and loot the union camps and was outraged to see young lieutenant among them none of that sir johnston roared at the officer we are not here for plunder then realizing he had embarrassed the man he picked up tin cup off table and announced let this be my share of the spoils today before directing his army onward at about pm while leading one of those charges against union camp near the peach orchard he was wounded taking bullet behind his right knee the bullet clipped part of his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood there were no medical personnel on scene at the time since johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded confederate troops and yankee prisoners earlier in the battle within few minutes johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting among his staff was isham harris the governor of tennessee who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that abraham lincoln had appointed andrew johnson as military governor of tennessee seeing johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale harris asked general are you wounded johnston glanced down at his leg wound then faced harris and replied in weak voice his last words yes and fear seriously harris and other staff officers removed johnston from his horse and carried him to small ravine near the hornets nest and desperately tried to aid the general who had lost consciousness by this point harris then sent an aide to fetch johnston surgeon but did not apply tourniquet to johnson wounded leg few minutes later before doctor could be found johnston died from blood loss it is believed that johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound ironically it was later discovered that johnston had tourniquet in his pocket when he died harris and the other officers wrapped general johnston body in blanket so as not to damage the troops morale with the sight of the dead general johnston and his wounded horse fire eater were taken to his field headquarters on the corinth road where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle beauregard assumed command of the army and resumed leading the confederate assault which continued advancing and pushed the union force back to final defensive line near the tennessee river with his army exhausted and daylight almost gone beauregard called off the final confederate attack around hours figuring he could finish off the union army the following morning however grant was reinforced by fresh troops from don carlos buell army of the ohio during the night and led successful counter attack the following day driving the confederates from the field and winning the battle as the confederate army retreated back to corinth johnston body was taken to the home of colonel william inge which had been his headquarters in corinth it was covered in the confederate flag and lay in state for several hours it is possible that confederate soldier fired the fatal round as many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers alonzo ridley of los angeles commanded the bodyguard the guides of gen johnston and was by his side when he fell johnston was the highest ranking fatality of the war on either side and his death was strong blow to the morale of the confederacy at the time davis considered him the best general in the country legacy and honors tomb and statue by elisabet ney in the texas state cemetery in austin texas johnston was survived by his wife eliza and six children his wife and five younger children including one born after he went to war chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with eliza brother dr john strother griffin johnston eldest son albert sidney jr born in texas had already followed him into the confederate states army in after taking home leave in los angeles albert jr was on his way out of san pedro harbor on ferry while steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry wave swamped the smaller boat causing its boilers to explode albert jr was killed in the accident upon his passing general johnston received the highest praise ever given by the confederate government accounts were published on december and thereafter in the los angeles star of his family hometown johnston street hancock street and griffin avenue each in northeast los angeles are named after the general and his family who lived in the neighborhood johnston was initially buried in new orleans in joint resolution of the texas legislature was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the texas state cemetery in austin the re interment occurred in forty years later the state appointed elisabet ney to design monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the grave site installed in the texas historical commission has erected historical marker near the entrance of what was once johnston plantation an adjacent marker was erected by the san

term android can mean either one of these while cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be creature that is combination of organic and mechanical parts the term droid popularized by george lucas in the original star wars film and now used widely within science fiction originated as an abridgment of android but has been used by lucas and others to mean any robot including distinctly non human form machines like the word android was used in star trek the original series episode what are little girls made of the abbreviation andy coined as pejorative by writer philip dick in his novel do androids dream of electric sheep has seen some further usage such as within the tv series total recall authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg in some fictional works the difference between robot and android is only superficial with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot like internal mechanics in other stories authors have used the word android to mean wholly organic yet artificial creation other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between eric wilson who defines an android as synthetic human being distinguishes between three types of android based on their body composition the mummy type made of dead things or stiff inanimate natural material such as mummies puppets dolls and statues the golem type made from flexible possibly organic material including golems and homunculi the automaton type made from mix of dead and living parts including automatons and robots although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness and automata devices that have independence projects several projects aiming to create androids that look and to certain degree speak or act like human being have been launched or are underway japan der japanese actroid japanese robotics have been leading the field since the waseda university initiated the wabot project in and in completed the wabot the first android full scale humanoid intelligent robot its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs and to grip and transport objects with hands using tactile sensors its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors artificial eyes and ears and its conversation system allowed it to communicate with person in japanese with an artificial mouth in wabot was revealed and made number of improvements it was capable of playing the organ wabot had ten fingers and two feet and was able to read score of music it was also able to accompany person in honda began its humanoid research and development program to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans the intelligent robotics lab directed by hiroshi ishiguro at osaka university and the kokoro company demonstrated the actroid at expo in aichi prefecture japan and released the telenoid in in kokoro developed new der android the height of the human body part of der is cm there are mobile points der can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body the air servosystem which kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator as result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via servosystem the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise der realized slimmer body than that of the former version by using smaller cylinder outwardly der has more beautiful proportion compared to the previous model der has thinner arms and wider repertoire of expressions once programmed it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice the intelligent mechatronics lab directed by hiroshi kobayashi at the tokyo university of science has developed an android head called saya which was exhibited at robodex in yokohama japan there are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time which will hopefully introduce broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future now saya is working at the science university of tokyo as guide the waseda university japan and ntt docomo manufacturers have succeeded in creating shape shifting robot wd it is capable of changing its face at first the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline eyes nose and so on of certain person the robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions they say the first version of the robot was first developed back in after that year later they made couple of major improvements to the design the robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy it uses driving system with dof unit the wd robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on mask with each point possessing three degrees of freedom this one has facial points for total of degrees of freedom as for the materials they used the wd mask is fabricated with highly elastic material called septom with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength other technical features reveal shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point driven by dc motor with simple pulley and slide screw apparently the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces to copy face they need only scanner to determine the locations of an individual facial points after that they are then driven into position using laptop and motor control boards in addition the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual hair style and skin color if photo of their face is projected onto the mask singapore prof nadia thalmann nanyang technological university scientist directed efforts of the institute for media innovation along with the

suppliers as well as exhibition halls and stadium for robot competitions the country new robotics ethics charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa united states walt disney and staff of imagineers created great moments with mr lincoln that debuted at the new york world fair dr william barry an education futurist and former visiting west point professor of philosophy and ethical reasoning at the united states military academy created an ai android character named maria bot this interface ai android was named after the infamous fictional robot maria in the film metropolis as well behaved distant relative maria bot is the first ai android teaching assistant at the university level maria bot has appeared as keynote speaker as duo with barry for tedx talk in everett washington in february dr william barry left with maria bot right resembling human from the shoulders up maria bot is virtual being android that has complex facial expressions and head movement and engages in conversation about variety of subjects she uses ai to process and synthesize information to make her own decisions on how to talk and engage she collects data through conversations direct data inputs such as books or articles and through internet sources maria bot was built by an international high tech company for barry to help improve education quality and eliminate education poverty maria bot is designed to create new ways for students to engage and discuss ethical issues raised by the increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence barry also uses maria bot to demonstrate that programming robot with life affirming ethical framework makes them more likely to help humans to do the same dr william barry right and fan pose with maria bot center maria bot is an ambassador robot for good and ethical ai technology hanson robotics inc of texas and kaist produced an android portrait of albert einstein using hanson facial android technology mounted on kaist life size walking bipedal robot body this einstein android also called albert hubo thus represents the first full body walking android in history see video at hanson robotics the fedex institute of technology and the university of texas at arlington also developed the android portrait of sci fi author philip dick creator of do androids dream of electric sheep the basis for the film blade runner with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author works in the pkd android won first place artificial intelligence award from aaai use in fiction androids are staple of science fiction isaac asimov pioneered the of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence notably in his series robot one thing common to most fictional androids is that the real life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human like robots such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence are assumed to have been solved fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans moving thinking and speaking as fluidly as them the tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance or even human ambitions of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions some android heroes seek like pinocchio to become human as in the film bicentennial man or data in star trek the next generation others as in the film westworld rebel against abuse by careless humans android hunter deckard in do androids dream of electric sheep and its film adaptation blade runner discovers that his targets appear to be in some ways more human than he is android stories therefore are not essentially stories about androids they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human one aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as mechanism for exploring racism in society as in blade runner perhaps the clearest example of this is john brunner novel into the slave nebula where the blue skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human more recently the androids bishop and annalee call in the films aliens and alien resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an other the video game detroit become human also explores how androids are treated as second class citizens in near future society female androids or gynoids are often seen in science fiction and can be viewed as continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical perfect woman examples include the greek myth of pygmalion and the female robot maria in fritz lang metropolis some gynoids like pris in blade runner are designed as sex objects with the intent of pleasing men violent sexual desires or as submissive servile companions such as in the stepford wives fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing essentialist ideas of femininity although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is way of exploring racism and misogyny in society the japanese film sayonara starring geminoid was promoted as the first movie to feature an android performing opposite human actor see also references further reading kerman judith retrofitting blade runner issues in ridley scott blade runner and philip dick do androids dream of electric

alberta is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of canada with an estimated population of people as of the census it is canada fourth most populous province and the most populous of canada three prairie provinces alberta area is approximately alberta is bordered by the provinces of british columbia to the west and saskatchewan to the east the northwest territories to the north and the state of montana to the south alberta is one of three canadian provinces and territories to border only single state it is also one of only two landlocked provinces in the country alberta capital edmonton is near the geographic centre of the province it is the primary supply and service hub for canada crude oil the athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries about south of edmonton is calgary the largest city in alberta calgary and edmonton anchor alberta two census metropolitan areas which each have populations exceeding one million while the province has census agglomerations indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now alberta for thousands of years prior to european colonization alberta and saskatchewan were originally districts of the northwest territories but became provinces on september key economic sectors in alberta include energy and clean technology agriculture and petrochemicals the oil industry has been pillar of alberta economy since when substantial oil deposits were discovered at leduc no well alberta current premier is jason kenney of the united conservative party which holds majority in the alberta legislative assembly tourist destinations in the province include banff canmore drumheller jasper sylvan lake and lake louise alberta is home to six unesco world heritage sites the canadian rocky mountain parks dinosaur provincial park the head smashed in buffalo jump waterton glacier international peace park wood buffalo national park and writing on stone áísínai pi the province has predominantly humid continental climate with stark contrasts over year but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming etymology alberta was named after princess louise caroline alberta the fourth daughter of queen victoria princess louise was the wife of john campbell marquess of lorne governor general of canada lake louise and mount alberta were also named in her honour the name alberta itself is feminine latinized form of the name albert cf masculine albertus in medieval latin and its germanic cognates ultimately derived from proto germanic aþalaberhtaz compound of noble bright famous geography topographic map of alberta showing cities towns municipal district county and rural municipality borders and natural features alberta with an area of is the fourth largest province after quebec ontario and british columbia alberta southern border is the th parallel north which separates it from the state of montana while the th parallel north divides it from the northwest territories the th meridian west separates it from the province of saskatchewan while on the west its boundary with british columbia follows the th meridian west south from the northwest territories at until it reaches the continental divide at the rocky mountains and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the continental divide in generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the montana border at the province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width its highest point is at the summit of mount columbia in the rocky mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the slave river in wood buffalo national park in the northeast with the exception of the semi arid steppe of the south eastern section the province has adequate water resources there are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming fishing and range of water sports there are three large lakes lake claire in wood buffalo national park lesser slave lake and lake athabasca which lies in both alberta and saskatchewan the longest river in the province is the athabasca river which travels from the columbia icefield in the rocky mountains to lake athabasca the largest river is the peace river with an average flow of the peace river originates in the rocky mountains of northern british columbia and flows through northern alberta and into the slave river tributary of the mackenzie river alberta capital city edmonton is located at about the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada the region with its proximity to canada largest oil fields has most of western canada oil refinery capacity calgary is about south of edmonton and north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost of the province population lives in the calgary edmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as means to populate the province in its early years moraine lake at banff national park the alberta mountain forests makes up the southwestern boundary of alberta most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and alberta british columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near brooks alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from alberta past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climate köppen climate types in alberta alberta has humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from in northern alberta to in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from in the mountains to over in southeastern alberta alberta is sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between up to just under hours per year northern alberta gets about hours of daylight in the summer alberta extends for over from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from in the southwest to in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from in the southeast to in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper type of intense fast moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and east central portions are prone to drought like conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation sometimes resulting in flooding in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging to chinook days per year calgary has chance of white christmas while edmonton has an chance semi arid steppe climate northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has semi arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north after saskatchewan alberta experiences the most tornadoes in canada with an average of verified per year thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern alberta the region surrounding the calgary edmonton corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in canada which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby rocky mountains enhancing the updraft downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail climate averages for

alberta ecology flora wild rose is the provincial flower of alberta in central and northern alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus anemone this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as march though april is the usual month for the general population other prairie flora known to flower early are the golden bean and wild rose members of the sunflower family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between july and september the southern and east central parts of alberta are covered by short prairie grass which dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower fleabane and sage both yellow and white sweet clover can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides these are largely deciduous typically aspen poplar and willow many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain on the north side of the north saskatchewan river evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres aspen poplar balsam poplar or in some parts cottonwood and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species conifers include jack pine rocky mountain pine lodgepole pine both white and black spruce and the deciduous conifer tamarack fauna bighorner in kananaskis country the bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of alberta the four climatic regions alpine boreal forest parkland and prairie of alberta are home to many different species of animals the south and central prairie was the land of the bison commonly known as buffalo its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made comeback living on farms and in parks all over alberta herbivorous animals are found throughout the province moose mule deer elk and white tailed deer are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern alberta bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake the prairie rattlesnake alberta is home to many large carnivores among them are the grizzly bears and black bears which are found in the mountains and wooded regions smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes wolves fox lynx bobcat and mountain lion cougar central and northern alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds vast numbers of ducks geese swans and pelicans arrive in alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern alberta eagles hawks owls and crows are plentiful and huge variety of smaller seed and insect eating birds can be found alberta like other temperate regions is home to mosquitoes flies wasps and bees rivers and lakes are populated with pike walleye whitefish rainbow speckled brown trout and sturgeon bull trout native to the province is alberta provincial fish turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province frogs and salamanders are few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta alberta is the only province in canada as well as one of the few places in the world that is free of norwegian rats since the early the government of alberta has operated rat control program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in several rats were found and captured in small pockets in southern alberta putting alberta rat free status in jeopardy colony of rats were subsequently found in landfill near medicine hat in and again in paleontology specimens at the royal tyrrell museum of paleontology located in the horseshoe canyon formation at dinosaur provincial park alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of late cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons isolated material microvertebrate remains and even mass graves at least dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province the foremost formation oldman formation and dinosaur park formations collectively comprise the judith river group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in alberta dinosaur bearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments history blackfoot confederacy warriors in macleod in paleo indians arrived in alberta at least years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for living after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of rupert land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudson bay company hbc in and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for fur bearing animals the first european explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of rupert land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name the mackenzie river which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in in the portion of louisiana north of the forty ninth parallel was ceded to great britain fort chipewyan trading post and regional headquarters for the hudson bay company in fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudson bay company dominated trade in alberta until when the newly formed canadian government purchased rupert land northern alberta was included in the north western territory until when it and rupert land became canada northwest territories the district of alberta was created as part of the north west territories in as settlement increased local representatives to the north west legislative assembly were added after long campaign for autonomy in the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier less than decade later the first world war presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production over of alberta doctors volunteered for service overseas st century downtown calgary was one of several areas afflicted during the alberta floods on june during the alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow elbow highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries dozen municipalities in southern alberta declared local states of emergency on june as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders in wildfire resulted in the largest fire evacuation of residents in alberta history as more than people were ordered to evacuate demographics population density of alberta the census reported alberta had population of living in of its total dwellings an change from its population of with land area of it had population density of in statistics canada estimated the province to have population of in of since alberta population has experienced relatively high rate of growth mainly because of its burgeoning economy between and the province had high birthrates on par with some larger provinces such as british columbia relatively high immigration and high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces in alberta continued to have the youngest population among the provinces with median age of years compared with the national median of years also in alberta had the smallest proportion of seniors among the provinces and one of the highest population shares of children further contributing to alberta young and growing population about of the population lives in urban areas and only about in rural areas the calgary edmonton corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of canada many of alberta cities and towns have experienced very high rates of growth in recent history alberta population rose from in to according to the census census information according to the census alberta has residents between the ages of residents between the ages of and residents aged and over english is the most common mother tongue with native speakers this is followed by french with native speakers tagalog with speakers german with speakers and punjabi with speakers residents identify as aboriginal including as first nations as métis and as inuit there are also residents who identify as visible minority including south asian people filipinos and chinese respondents residents hold postsecondary certificate diploma or degree residents have obtained secondary high school diploma or equivalency certificate and residents do not have any certificate diploma or degree the census found that english with native speakers was the most common mother tongue of albertans representing of the population the next most common mother tongues were chinese with native speakers followed by german with native speakers and french with other mother tongues include punjabi with native speakers tagalog with ukrainian with spanish with polish with arabic with dutch with and vietnamese with the most common aboriginal language is cree other common mother tongues include italian with speakers urdu with and korean with then hindi farsi portuguese and hungarian alberta has considerable ethnic diversity in line with the rest of canada many are descended from immigrants of western european nations notably england scotland ireland wales and france but large numbers later came from other regions of europe notably germany ukraine and scandinavia according to statistics canada alberta is home to the second highest proportion two percent of francophones in western canada after manitoba despite this relatively few albertans claim french as their mother tongue many of alberta french speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province after migration from other areas of canada or descending from métis as reported in the census the chinese represented nearly four percent of alberta population and south asians represented more than two percent both edmonton and calgary have historic chinatowns and calgary has canada third largest chinese community the chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the canadian pacific railway in the aboriginal albertans make up approximately three percent of the population in the canadian census the most commonly reported ethnic origins among albertans were english german canadian scottish irish french ukrainian dutch polish north american indian norwegian and chinese each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable amongst those of british heritage the scots have had particularly strong influence on place names with the names of many cities and towns including calgary airdrie canmore and banff having scottish origins alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after british columbia and ontario with of the population consisting of visible minorities in over one third of the populations of calgary and edmonton belong to visible minority group aboriginal identity peoples made up of the population in about half of whom consist of first nations and the other half are métis there are also small number of inuit people in alberta the number of aboriginal identity peoples have been increasing at rate greater than the population of alberta as of the national household survey the largest religious group was roman catholic representing of the population alberta had the second highest percentage of non religious residents among the provinces after british columbia at of the population of the remainder of the population identified themselves as belonging to the united church of canada while were anglican lutherans made up of the population while baptists comprised the remainder belonged to wide variety of different religious affiliations none of which constituted more than of the population members of lds church are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province alberta has population of hutterites communal anabaptist sect similar to the mennonites and has significant population of seventh day adventists alberta is home to several byzantine rite churches as part of the legacy of eastern european immigration including the ukrainian catholic eparchy of edmonton and the ukrainian orthodox church of canada western diocese which is based in edmonton muslims made up of the population sikhs buddhists and hindus many of these are immigrants but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies canada oldest mosque the al rashid mosque is located in edmonton whereas calgary is home to canada largest mosque the baitun nur mosque alberta is also home to growing jewish population of about people who constituted of alberta population most of alberta jews live in the metropolitan areas of calgary and edmonton municipalities

no economy petroleum resources in alberta alberta economy was one of the strongest in the world supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to lesser extent agriculture and technology in alberta per capita gdp exceeded that of the united states norway or switzerland and was the highest of any province in canada at this was higher than the national average of and more than twice that of some of the atlantic provinces in the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in canadian history according to the census the median annual family income after taxes was in alberta compared to in canada as whole in alberta had the second largest economy in canada after ontario with gdp exceeding the gdp of the province calculated at basic prices rose by in to billion which was the largest increase recorded in canada and it ended two consecutive years of decreases alberta debt to gdp ratio is projected to peak at in fiscal year falling to the following year the calgary edmonton corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in canada the region covers distance of roughly kilometres north to south in the population of the calgary edmonton corridor was million of alberta population it is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country study by td bank financial group found the corridor to be the only canadian urban centre to amass level of wealth while maintaining canadian style quality of life offering universal health care benefits the study found that gdp per capita in the corridor was above average metropolitan areas and above other canadian cities at that time the fraser institute states that alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates alberta as the freest economy in canada and second freest economy amongst states and canadian provinces in merchandise exports totalled us billion energy revenues totalled billion and energy resource exports totalled billion farm cash receipts from agricultural products totalled billion shipments of forest products totalled billion while exports were billion manufacturing sales totaled billion and alberta ict industries generated over billion in revenue in total alberta gdp amassed billion in dollars or billion in dollars in alberta gdp grew despite low oil prices however it was unstable with growth rates as high and as low as should the gdp remain at an average of for the last two quarters of alberta gdp should exceed billion by the end of however rbc economics research predicts alberta real gdp growth to only average for the last two quarters of this estimate predicts real gdp growth of only for positive is the predicted growth in nominal gdp and possibly above in along with saskatchewan alberta greenhouse gas emissions are over three times the national per capita average with no plan to significantly reduce emissions in the future agriculture and forestry rocky view nearly one half of canadian beef is produced in alberta agriculture has significant position in the province economy the province has over three million head of cattle and alberta beef has healthy worldwide market nearly one half of all canadian beef is produced in alberta alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo bison for the consumer market sheep for wool and mutton are also raised wheat and canola are primary farm crops with alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production other grains are also prominent much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation continuous cropping in which there is no fallow season is gradually becoming more common mode of production because of increased profits and reduction of soil erosion across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing farmers typically truck the grain to central points alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta then migrating north during the summer into the peace river valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need canola field in alberta forestry plays vital role in alberta economy providing over jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually uses for harvested timber include pulpwood hardwood engineered wood and bioproducts such as chemicals and biofuels recently the united states has been canada and alberta largest importer of hardwood and pulpwood although continued trades issues with the have likely been contributing factor towards alberta increased focus on asian markets industry alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil synthetic crude natural gas and gas products in canada alberta is the world second largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth largest producer two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in north america are located in central and north central alberta in both red deer and edmonton polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world edmonton oil refineries provide the raw materials for large petrochemical industry to the east of edmonton the athabasca oil sands surrounding fort mcmurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be trillion barrels km many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands as of late there were over billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil the oil price increases since have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even loss by mid however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects an example of this was the shelving of the joslyn north project in the athabasca region in may with concerted effort and support from the provincial government several high tech industries have found their birth in alberta notably patents related to interactive liquid crystal display systems with growing economy alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds tourism the three sisters at bow valley provincial park in canmore alberta has been tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing hiking and camping shopping locales such as west edmonton mall calgary stampede outdoor festivals professional athletic events international sporting competitions such as the commonwealth games and olympic games as well as more eclectic attractions according to alberta economic development calgary and edmonton both host over four million visitors annually banff jasper and the rocky mountains are visited by about three million people per year alberta tourism relies heavily on southern ontario tourists as well as tourists from other parts of canada the united states and many other countries there are also natural attractions like elk island national park wood buffalo national park and the columbia icefield alberta rockies include well known tourist destinations banff national park and jasper national park the two mountain parks are connected by the scenic icefields parkway banff is located west of calgary on highway and jasper is located west of edmonton on yellowhead highway five of canada fourteen unesco world heritage sites are located within the province canadian rocky mountain parks waterton glacier international peace park wood buffalo national park dinosaur provincial park and head smashed in buffalo jump number of these areas hold ski resorts most notably sunshine village lake louise marmot basin norquay and nakiska bronco riding at the calgary stampede the event is one of the world largest rodeos about million people visit the calgary stampede celebration of canada own wild west and the cattle ranching industry about people enjoy edmonton days formerly klondike days and capital ex edmonton was the gateway to the only all canadian route to the yukon gold fields and the only route which did not require gold seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous chilkoot pass another tourist destination that draws more than visitors each year is the drumheller valley located northeast of calgary drumheller dinosaur capital of the world offers the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology drumheller also had rich mining history being one of western canada largest coal producers during the war years another attraction in east central alberta is alberta prairie railway excursions popular tourist attraction operated out of stettler that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year environmental issues government and politics the government of alberta is organized as parliamentary democracy with unicameral legislature its unicameral legislature the legislative assembly consists of members elected first past the post fptp from single member constituencies locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately their boundaries do not necessarily coincide the alberta legislative building serves as the meeting place for the legislative assembly of alberta as queen of canada elizabeth ii is the head of state for the government of alberta her duties in alberta are carried out by lieutenant governor salma lakhani the queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and constitutional convention the lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the queen the government is headed by the premier the premier is normally member of the legislative assembly and draws all the members of the cabinet from among the members of the legislative assembly the city of edmonton is the seat of the provincial government the capital of alberta the premier is jason kenney sworn in on april alberta elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other canadian provinces since the alberta has had three main political parties the progressive conservatives conservatives or tories the liberals and the social democratic new democrats the wildrose party more conservative party formed in early gained much support in the election and became the official opposition role it held until when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new united conservative party created by the merger of wildrose and the progressive conservatives the strongly conservative social credit party was power in alberta for many decades but fell from the political map after the progressive conservatives came to power in for years the progressive conservatives governed alberta they lost the election to the ndp which formed their own government for the first time in provincial history breaking almost consecutive years of right wing rule suggesting at the time possible shift to the left in the province also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of alberta major cities since becoming province in alberta has seen only five changes of government only six parties have governed alberta the liberals from to the united farmers of alberta from to the social credit party from to the progressive conservative party from to from to the alberta new democratic party and from the united conservative party law enforcement royal canadian mounted police officers in st albert the rcmp provides municipal policing throughout most of alberta policing in the province of alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the royal northwest mounted police in due to pressures of world war the alberta provincial police was created this organization policed the province until it was disbanded as great depression era cost cutting measure in it was at that time the now renamed royal canadian mounted police resumed policing of the province specifically rcmp division with the advent of the alberta sheriffs branch the distribution of duties of law enforcement in alberta has been evolving as certain aspects such as traffic enforcement mobile surveillance and the close protection of the premier of alberta have been transferred to the sheriffs in alberta formed the alberta law enforcement response teams alert to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it alert is made up of members of the rcmp sheriffs branch and various major municipal police forces in alberta military military bases in alberta include canadian forces base cfb cold lake cfb edmonton cfb suffield and cfb wainwright air force units stationed at cfb cold lake have access to the cold lake air weapons range cfb edmonton is the headquarters for the rd canadian division cfb suffield hosts british troops and is the largest training facility in canada taxation according to alberta budget government revenue in that year came mainly from royalties on non renewable natural resources personal income taxes corporate and other taxes and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects in alberta received billion in bitumen royalties with the drop in the price of oil in it was down to billion in alberta received about million in royalty payments from oil sands royalty projects according to the fiscal plan the two top sources of revenue in were personal income tax at million and federal transfers of million with total resource revenue at million alberta is the only province in canada without provincial sales tax alberta residents are still subject to the federal sales tax the goods and services tax of revenue source in millions of dollars personal income tax federal transfers other tax revenue corporate income tax premiums fees and licenses investment income resource revenue other resource revenue bitumen royalties net income from business enterprises total revenue in alberta became the only canadian province to have flat tax of of taxable income which was introduced by then premier ralph klein as part of the alberta tax advantage which also included zero percent tax on income below generous personal exemption in under then premier rachel notley while most albertans continued to pay the per cent income tax rate new tax brackets per cent per cent and per cent for those with higher incomes annually or more were introduced alberta personal income tax system maintained progressive character by continuing to grant residents personal tax exemptions of in addition to variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities students and the aged alberta municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co operation with the provincial government by most albertans continued to pay the per cent income tax rate according to march statistics canada report the median household income in alberta in was about which is per cent higher than the canadian national average based on statistic canada reports low income albertans who earn less than and those in the high income bracket earning or more are the lowest taxed people in canada those in the middle income brackets representing those that earn about to pay more in provincial taxes than residents in british columbia and ontario in terms of income tax alberta is the best province for those with low income because there is no provincial income tax for those who earn or less even with the progressive tax brackets up to albertans who have the highest incomes those with annual income or more about people in pay the least in taxes in canada about million albertans earned between and in alberta also privatized alcohol distribution by privatization had increased outlets from stores to jobs to jobs and products to products tax revenue also increased from million to million in alberta collected about billion in education property taxes from municipalities albertan municipalities raise significant portion of their income through levying property taxes the value of assessed property in alberta was approximately billion in most real property is assessed according to its market value the exceptions to market value assessment are farmland railways machinery equipment and linear property all of which is assessed by regulated rates depending on the property type property owners may appeal property assessment to their municipal local assessment review board composite assessment review board or the alberta municipal government board culture summer brings many festivals to the province of alberta especially in edmonton the edmonton fringe festival is the world second largest after the edinburgh festival both calgary and edmonton host number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals the city heritage days festival sees the participation of over ethnic groups edmonton churchill square is home to large number of the festivals including the large taste of edmonton the works art design festival throughout the summer months the city of calgary is also famous for its stampede dubbed the greatest outdoor show on earth the stampede is canada biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions such as calf roping and bull riding in line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique alberta western heritage crafts an ice hockey game between the calgary flames and the edmonton oilers two teams in the national hockey league the banff centre hosts range of festivals and other events including the international mountain film festival these cultural events in alberta highlight the province cultural diversity most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as edmonton arts barns and the francis winspear centre for music both calgary and edmonton are home to canadian football league and national hockey league teams the stampeders flames and edmonton football team oilers respectively soccer rugby union and lacrosse are also played professionally in alberta in the then minister of culture and tourism ricardo miranda announced the alberta artist in residence program in conjunction with the province first month of the artist to celebrate the arts and the value they bring to the province both socially and economically the artist is selected each year via public and competitive process is expected to do community outreach and attend events to promote the arts through out the province the award comes with funding which includes travel and materials costs on january lauren crazybull named alberta st artist in residence alberta is the first province to launch an artist in residence program in canada education as with any canadian province the alberta legislature has almost exclusive authority to make laws respecting education since the legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to as well as to create and regulate universities colleges technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions public charter schools private schools home schooling elementary and secondary there are forty two public school jurisdictions in alberta and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have catholic electorate and one st albert has protestant electorate in addition one protestant separate school district glen avon survives as ward of the st paul education region the city of lloydminster straddles the alberta saskatchewan border and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers both of them operate according to saskatchewan law for many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing education prior to public and separate school boards in alberta had the legislative authority to levy local tax on property as supplementary support for local education in the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards but not for separate school boards since there has continued to be tax on property in support of education the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government the relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of education provided by school boards the provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them according to formula to public and separate school jurisdictions and francophone authorities public and separate school boards charter schools and private schools all follow the program of studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education alberta education homeschool tutors may choose to follow the program of studies or develop their own program of studies public and separate schools charter schools and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by alberta education they administer provincial achievement tests and diploma examinations set by alberta education and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by alberta education post secondary the university of alberta in the institution is the oldest and largest university in alberta the university of alberta located in edmonton and established in is alberta oldest and largest university the university of calgary once affiliated with the university of alberta gained its autonomy in and is now the second largest university in alberta athabasca university which focuses on distance learning and the university of lethbridge are located in athabasca and lethbridge respectively in early september mount royal university became calgary second public university and in late september similar move made macewan university edmonton second public university there are colleges that receive direct public funding along with two technical institutes northern alberta institute of technology and southern alberta institute of technology two of the colleges red deer college and grande prairie regional college were approved by the alberta government to become degree granting universities there are also many private post secondary institutions mostly christian universities bringing the total number of universities to students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions there was some controversy in over the rising cost of post secondary education for students as opposed to taxpayers in premier ralph klein made promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs health care alberta provides publicly funded fully integrated health system through alberta health services ahs quasi independent agency that delivers health care on behalf of the government of alberta ministry of health the alberta government provides health services for all its residents as set out by the provisions of the canada health act of alberta became canada second province after saskatchewan to adopt tommy douglas style program in precursor to the modern medicare system alberta health care budget was billion during the fiscal year approximately of all government spending making it the best funded health care system per capita in canada every hour the province spends more

trains include via rail canadian toronto vancouver or jasper prince rupert trains which use the cn mainline and pass through jasper national park and parallel the yellowhead highway during at least part of their routes the rocky mountaineer operates two sections one from vancouver to banff and calgary over cp tracks and section that travels over cn tracks to jasper road alberta has over of highways and roads of which nearly are paved the main north south corridor is highway which begins south of cardston at the carway border crossing and is part of the canamex corridor highway which effectively extends interstate into alberta and is the busiest gateway to the province begins at the coutts border crossing and ends at lethbridge highway joins lethbridge to fort macleod and links highway to highway highway travels north through fort macleod calgary red deer and edmonton alberta highway cowboy trail at the transcanada highway north of edmonton the highway continues to athabasca then northwesterly along the south shore of lesser slave lake into high prairie north to peace river west to fairview and finally south to grande prairie where it ends at an interchange with highway the section of highway between calgary and edmonton has been named the queen elizabeth ii highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in highway is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it highway west of highway known as cowboy trail and highway east of highway highway travels northwest into grande prairie and the peace river country highway travels northeast to fort mcmurray the location of the athabasca oil sands alberta has two main east west corridors the southern corridor part of the trans canada highway system enters the province near medicine hat runs westward through calgary and leaves alberta through banff national park the northern corridor also part of the trans canada network and known as the yellowhead highway highway runs west from lloydminster in eastern alberta through edmonton and jasper national park into british columbia one of the most scenic drives is along the icefields parkway which runs for between jasper and lake louise with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length third corridor stretches across southern alberta highway runs between crowsnest pass and medicine hat through lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the crowsnest highway another major corridor through central alberta is highway also known as the david thompson highway which runs east from the saskatchewan river

actinopterygii new latin actino having rays ancient greek πτέρυξ ptérux wing fins members of which are known as ray finned fishes is clade traditionally class or subclass of the bony fishes the ray finned fishes are so called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines rays as opposed to the fleshy lobed fins that characterize the class sarcopterygii lobe finned fish these actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements the radials which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton pelvic and pectoral girdles numerically are the dominant class of vertebrates comprising nearly of the over species of fish they are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams extant species can range in size from paedocypris at to the massive ocean sunfish at and the long bodied oarfish at characteristics dorsal fin fin rays lateral line kidney swim bladder weberian apparatus inner ear brain nostrils eye gills heart stomach gall bladder spleen internal sex organs ovaries or testes ventral fins spine anal fin tail caudal fin possible other parts not shown barbels adipose fin external genitalia gonopodium ray finned fishes occur in many variant forms the main features of typical ray finned fish are shown in the adjacent diagram the swim bladder is the more derived structure ray finned fishes have many different types of scales but all teleosts the most advanced have leptoid scales the outer part of these scales fan out with bony ridges while the inner part is crossed with fibrous connective tissue leptoid scales are thinner and more transparent than other types of scales and lack the hardened enamel or dentine like layers found in the scales of many other fish unlike ganoid scales which are found in non teleost new scales are added in concentric layers as the fish grows ray finned and lobe finned fishes including tetrapods possessed lungs used for aerial respiration only bichirs retain ventrally budding lungs fin arrangements ray finned fish are very varied in size and shape and in the number of their ray fins and the manner in which they arrange them reproduction three spined stickleback males red belly build nests and compete to attract females to lay eggs in them males then defend and fan the eggs painting by alexander francis lydon in nearly all ray finned fish the sexes are separate and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid development then proceeds with free swimming larval stage however other patterns of ontogeny exist with one of the commonest being sequential hermaphroditism in most cases this involves protogyny fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage triggered by some internal or external factor protandry where fish converts from male to female is much less common than protogyny most families use external rather than internal fertilization of the oviparous teleosts most do not provide parental care viviparity ovoviviparity or some form of parental care for eggs whether by the male the female or both parents is seen in significant fraction of the teleost families no care is likely the ancestral condition viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about of teleost species male care is far more common than female care male territoriality preadapts species for evolving male parental care there are few examples of fish that self fertilise the mangrove rivulus is an amphibious simultaneous hermaphrodite producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation this mode of reproduction may be related to the fish habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits males are occasionally produced at temperatures below and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female this maintains genetic variability in species that is otherwise highly inbred fossil record right the earliest known fossil actinopterygian is andreolepis hedei dating back million years late silurian remains have been found in russia sweden and estonia classification actinopterygia is divided into the subclasses chondrostei and neopterygii the neopterygii in turn is divided into the infraclasses holostei and teleostei during the mesozoic and cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely and as result of all known fish species are teleosts the cladogram shows the major groups of and their relationship to the terrestrial vertebrates tetrapods that evolved from related group of fish approximate dates are from near et al the polypterids bichirs and reedfish are the sister lineage of all other the sturgeons and paddlefishes are the sister lineage of neopterygii and holostei bowfin and gars are the sister lineage of teleosts the elopomorpha eels and tarpons appear to be the most basal teleosts chondrostei pxatlantic sturgeon chondrostei cartilage bone is subclass of primarily cartilaginous fish showing some ossification earlier definitions of chondrostei are now known to be paraphyletic meaning that this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor there were species divided among two orders the sturgeons and paddlefishes and the polypteriformes reedfishes and bichirs reedfish and birchirs are now separated from the chondrostei into their own sister lineage the cladistia it is thought that the chondrosteans evolved from bony fish but lost the bony hardening of their cartilaginous skeletons resulting in lightening of the frame elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton suggesting that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish this group had once been classified with the sharks the similarities are obvious as not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone but the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish and both lack scales excluding the polypteriforms additional shared features include spiracles and in sturgeons heterocercal tail the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin however the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the teleostei than their external appearance might suggest neopterygii pxatlantic salmon neopterygii new fins is subclass of ray finned fish that appeared somewhere in the late permian there were only few changes during its evolution from the earlier neopterygians are very successful group of fishes because they can move more rapidly than their ancestors their scales and skeletons began to lighten during their evolution and their jaws became more powerful and efficient while and the ampullae of lorenzini is present in all other groups of fish with the exception of hagfish neopterygians have lost this sense though it later re evolved within gymnotiformes and catfishes who possess nonhomologous teleost ampullae skeleton of the angler fish lophius piscatorius the first spine of the dorsal fin of the anglerfish is modified so it functions like fishing rod with lure

albert einstein march april was german born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity one of the two pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science he is best known to the general public for his mass energy equivalence formula which has been dubbed the world most famous equation he received the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect pivotal step in the development of quantum theory the son of salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory einstein was born in the german empire but moved to switzerland in forsaking his german citizenship the following year specializing in physics and mathematics he received his academic teaching diploma from the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich in the following year he acquired swiss citizenship which he kept for his entire life after initially struggling to find work from to he was employed as patent examiner at the swiss patent office in bern near the beginning of his career einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field this led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as patent clerk in called his annus mirabilis miracle year he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect the second explained brownian motion the third introduced special relativity and the fourth mass energy equivalence that year at the age of he was awarded phd by the university of zurich although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community einstein works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements he was invited to teach theoretical physics at the university of bern in and the following year moved to the university of zurich then in to charles university in prague before returning to eth the newly renamed federal polytechnic school in zürich in in he was elected to the prussian academy of sciences in berlin where he remained for years soon after publishing his work on special relativity einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields he then published paper on general relativity in introducing his theory of gravitation he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules he also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation the basis of the laser which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light in he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe in while einstein was visiting the united states adolf hitler came to power because of his jewish background einstein did not return to germany he settled in the united states and became an american citizen in on the eve of world war ii he endorsed letter to president franklin roosevelt alerting him to the potential german nuclear weapons program and recommending that the us begin similar research einstein supported the allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons einstein was affiliated with the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey until his death in he published more than scientific papers and more than non scientific works his intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius eugene wigner compared him to his contemporaries writing that einstein understanding was deeper even than jancsi von neumann his mind was both more penetrating and more original than von neumann life and career early life and education einstein at the age of in start of speech by albert einstein ladies coughs and gentlemen our age is proud of the progress it has made in man intellectual development the search and striving for truth and knowledge is one of the highest of man qualities united jewish appeal april radio universidad nacional de la plata argentina albert einstein was born in ulm in the kingdom of württemberg in the german empire on march his parents were hermann einstein salesman and engineer and pauline koch in the family moved to munich where einstein father and his uncle jakob founded fabrik einstein cie company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current the einsteins were non observant ashkenazi jews and albert attended catholic elementary school in munich from the age of for three years at the age of he was transferred to the luitpold gymnasium now known as the albert einstein gymnasium where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later in hermann and jakob company lost bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current dc standard to the more efficient alternating current ac standard the loss forced the sale of the munich factory in search of business the einstein family moved to italy first to milan and few months later to pavia when the family moved to pavia einstein then stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering but einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school regimen and teaching method he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning at the end of december he traveled to italy to join his family in pavia convincing the school to let him go by using doctor note during his time in italy he wrote short essay with the title on the investigation of the state of the ether in magnetic field einstein always excelled at math and physics from young age reaching mathematical level years ahead of his peers the twelve year old einstein taught himself algebra and euclidean geometry over single summer einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the pythagorean theorem at age family tutor max talmud says that after he had given the year old einstein geometry textbook after short time einstein had worked through the whole book he thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high could not follow his passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve year old to become convinced that nature could be understood as mathematical structure einstein started teaching himself calculus at and as year old he says he had mastered integral and differential calculus albert einstein in age matriculation certificate at age when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy and music einstein was introduced to kant critique of pure reason and kant became his favorite philosopher his tutor stating at the time he was still child only thirteen years old yet kant works to ordinary mortals seemed to be clear to him in at the age of einstein took the entrance examinations for the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich later the eidgenössische technische hochschule eth he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics on the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school he attended the argovian cantonal school gymnasium in aarau switzerland in and to complete his secondary schooling while lodging with the family of professor jost winteler he fell in love with winteler daughter marie albert sister maja later married winteler son paul in january with his father approval einstein renounced his citizenship in the german kingdom of württemberg to avoid military service in september he passed the swiss matura with mostly good grades including top grade of in physics and mathematical subjects on scale of at he enrolled in the four year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the zürich polytechnic school marie winteler who was year older moved to olsberg switzerland for teaching post einstein future wife year old serbian named mileva marić also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year she was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course over the next few years einstein and marić friendship developed into romance and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra curricular physics in which they were both interested einstein wrote in his letters to marić that he preferred studying alongside her in einstein passed the exams in maths and physics and was awarded the federal teaching diploma there is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate marić might have collaborated with einstein prior to his papers known as the annus mirabilis papers and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions marriages and children mileva einstein early correspondence between einstein and marić was discovered and published in which revealed that the couple had daughter named lieserl born in early in novi sad where marić was staying with her parents marić returned to switzerland without the child whose real name and fate are unknown the contents of einstein letter in september suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy einstein with his second wife elsa in einstein and marić married in january in may their son hans albert einstein was born in bern switzerland their son eduard was born in zürich in july the couple moved to berlin in april but marić returned to zürich with their sons after learning that despite their close relationship before einstein chief romantic attraction was now his first and second cousin elsa they divorced on february having lived apart for five years eduard had breakdown at about age and was diagnosed with schizophrenia his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods finally being committed permanently after her death in letters revealed in einstein wrote to his early love marie winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her he wrote in while his wife was pregnant with their second child think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only man can be he spoke about misguided love and missed life regarding his love for marie einstein married elsa löwenthal in after having relationship with her since she was first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally they emigrated to the united states in elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in and died in december in einstein fell in love with secretary named betty neumann the niece of close friend hans mühsam in volume of letters released by hebrew university of jerusalem in einstein described about six women including margarete lebach blonde austrian estella the rich owner of florist business toni mendel wealthy jewish widow and ethel michanowski berlin socialite with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to elsa later after the death of his second wife elsa einstein was briefly in relationship with margarita konenkova konenkova was russian spy who was married to the noted russian sculptor sergei konenkov who created the bronze bust of einstein at the institute for advanced study at princeton friends among einstein well known friends were michele besso paul ehrenfest marcel grossmann jános plesch daniel posin maurice solovine stephen samuel wise and fritz haber patent office albert einstein in age after graduating in einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for teaching post he acquired swiss citizenship in february but for medical reasons was not conscripted with the help of marcel grossmann father he secured job in bern at the federal office for intellectual property the patent office as an assistant examiner level iii einstein evaluated patent applications for variety of devices including gravel sorter and an typewriter in his position at the swiss patent office became permanent although he was passed over for promotion until he fully mastered machine technology much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical mechanical synchronization of time two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time olympia academy founders conrad habicht maurice solovine and einstein with few friends he had met in bern einstein started small discussion group in self mockingly named the olympia academy which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy sometimes they were joined by mileva who attentively listened but did not participate their readings included the works of henri poincaré ernst mach and david hume which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook first scientific papers in einstein paper folgerungen aus den conclusions from the capillarity phenomena was published in the journal annalen der physik on april einstein completed his thesis with alfred kleiner professor of experimental physics serving as pro forma advisor as result einstein was awarded phd by the university of zürich with his dissertation new determination of molecular dimensions also in which has been called einstein annus mirabilis amazing year he published four groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect brownian motion special relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world at the age of academic career by he was recognized as leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern the following year after he gave lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the university of zurich alfred kleiner recommended him to the faculty for newly created professorship in theoretical physics einstein was appointed associate professor in einstein became full professor at the german charles ferdinand university in prague in april accepting austrian citizenship in the austro hungarian empire to do so during his prague stay he wrote scientific works five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids in july he returned to his alma mater in zürich from until he was professor of theoretical physics at the eth zurich where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics he also studied continuum mechanics the molecular theory of heat and the problem of gravitation on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel grossmann the new york times reported confirmation of the einstein theory specifically the bending of light by gravitation based on may eclipse observations in principe africa and sobral brazil after the findings were presented on november to joint meeting in london of the royal society and the royal astronomical society full text on july he was voted for membership in the prussian academy of sciences in berlin max planck and walther nernst visited him the next week in zurich to persuade him to join the academy additionally offering him the post of director at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics which was soon to be established membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at humboldt university of berlin he was officially elected to the academy on july and he moved to berlin the following year his decision to move to berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin elsa with whom he had started romantic affair he joined the academy and thus berlin university on april as world war broke out that year the plan for kaiser wilhelm institute for physics was aborted the institute was established on october with einstein as its director in einstein was elected president of the german physical society einstein official portrait after receiving the nobel prize in physics based on calculations einstein had made in using his new theory of general relativity light from another star should be bent by the sun gravity in that prediction was confirmed by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of may those observations were published in the international media making einstein world famous on november the leading british newspaper the times printed banner headline that read revolution in science new theory of the universe newtonian ideas overthrown in he became foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in he was awarded the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as discovery of the law as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the derivation of the planck spectrum by bose einstein was elected foreign member of the royal society formemrs in he also received the copley medal from the royal society in travels abroad einstein visited new york city for the first time on april where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis hylan followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions he went on to deliver several lectures at columbia university and princeton university and in washington he accompanied representatives of the national academy of science on visit to the white house on his return to europe he was the guest of the british statesman and philosopher viscount haldane in london where he met several renowned scientific intellectual and political figures and delivered lecture at king college london he also published an essay my first impression of the in july in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans much as had alexis de tocqueville who published his own impressions in democracy in america for some of his observations einstein was clearly surprised what strikes visitor is the joyous positive attitude to life the american is friendly self confident optimistic and without envy in his travels took him to asia and later to palestine as part of six month excursion and speaking tour as he visited singapore ceylon and japan where he gave series of lectures to thousands of japanese after his first public lecture he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace where thousands came to watch in letter to his sons he described his impression of the japanese as being modest intelligent considerate and having true feel for art in his own travel diaries from his visit to asia he expresses some views on the chinese japanese and indian people which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in because of einstein travels to the far east he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december in his place the banquet speech was made by german diplomat who praised einstein not only as scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist on his return voyage he visited palestine for days his only visit to that region he was greeted as if he were head of state rather than physicist which included cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner sir herbert samuel during one reception the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him in einstein talk to the audience he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as force in the world einstein visited spain for two weeks in where he briefly met santiago ramón cajal and also received diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him member of the spanish academy of sciences albert einstein at session of the international committee on intellectual cooperation league of nations of which he was member from to from to einstein was member of the international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations in geneva with few months of interruption in body created to promote international exchange between scientists researchers teachers artists and intellectuals originally slated to serve as the swiss delegate secretary general eric drummond was persuaded by catholic activists oskar halecki and giuseppe motta to instead have him become the german delegate thus allowing gonzague de reynold to take the swiss spot from which he promoted traditionalist catholic values einstein former physics professor hendrik lorentz and the polish chemist marie curie were also members of the committee travel to the us in december einstein visited america for the second time originally intended as two month working visit as research fellow at the california institute of technology after the national attention he received during his first trip to the us he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly he declined them all after arriving in new york city einstein was taken to various places and events including chinatown lunch with the editors of the new york times and performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival during the days following he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university who described einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind harry emerson fosdick pastor at new york riverside church gave einstein tour of the church and showed him full size statue that the church made of einstein standing at the entrance also during his stay in new york he joined crowd of people at madison square garden during hanukkah celebration einstein left and charlie chaplin at the hollywood premiere of city lights january einstein next traveled to california where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert millikan his friendship with millikan was awkward as millikan had penchant for patriotic militarism where einstein was pronounced pacifist during an address to caltech students einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin both noted for their pacifism carl laemmle head of universal studios gave einstein tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin they had an instant rapport with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife elsa to his home for dinner chaplin said einstein outward persona calm and gentle seemed to conceal highly emotional temperament from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy chaplin film city lights was to premiere few days later in hollywood and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests walter isaacson einstein biographer described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity chaplin visited einstein at his home on later trip to berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis immigration to the us cartoon of einstein after shedding his pacifism wings charles macauley in february while on visit to the united states einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germany new chancellor adolf hitler while at american universities in early he undertook his third two month visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena he and his wife elsa returned to europe in march and during the trip they learned that the german reichstag passed the enabling act which was passed on march and transformed hitler government into de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to berlin later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated upon landing in antwerp belgium on march he immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport formally renouncing his german citizenship the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into hitler youth camp refugee status albert einstein landing card may when he landed in dover united kingdom from ostende belgium to visit oxford in april einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions including teaching at universities historian gerald holton describes how with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed month later einstein works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming jewish intellectualism is dead one german magazine included him in list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase not yet hanged offering bounty on his head in subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born who had already emigrated from germany to england einstein wrote must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of surprise after moving to the us he described the book burnings as spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment and more than anything else in the world fear the influence of men of intellectual independence einstein was now without permanent home unsure where he would live and work and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany he rented house in de haan belgium where he lived for few months in late july he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver locker lampson who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years locker lampson invited him to stay near his home in wooden cabin on roughton heath in the parish of to protect einstein locker lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein published in the daily herald on july locker lampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home and later austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately and sent his friend physicist frederick lindemann to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities churchill later observed that as result of germany having driven the jews out they had lowered their technical standards and put the allies technology ahead of theirs einstein later contacted leaders of other nations including turkey prime minister smet nönü to whom he wrote in september requesting placement of unemployed german jewish scientists as result of einstein letter jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over saved individuals locker lampson also submitted bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein during which period einstein made number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe in one of his speeches he denounced germany treatment of jews while at the same time he introduced bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere in his speech he described einstein as citizen of the world who should be offered temporary shelter in the uk both bills failed however and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey us to become resident scholar resident scholar at the institute for advanced study portrait of einstein taken in at princeton in october einstein returned to the us and took up position at the institute for advanced study noted for having become refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany at the time most american universities including harvard princeton and yale had minimal or no jewish faculty or students as result of their jewish quotas which lasted until the late einstein was still undecided on his future he had offers from several european universities including christ church oxford where he stayed for three short periods between may and june and was offered year studentship but in he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship einstein affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in he was one of the four first selected two of the others being john von neumann and kurt gödel at the new institute where he soon developed close friendship with gödel the two would take long walks together discussing their work bruria kaufman his assistant later became physicist during this period einstein tried to develop unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics both unsuccessfully world war ii and the manhattan project in group of hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist leó szilárd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research the group warnings were discounted einstein and szilárd along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such weapon to make certain the us was aware of the danger in july few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe szilárd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs which einstein pacifist said he had never considered he was asked to lend his support by writing letter with szilárd to president roosevelt recommending the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research the letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the entry into world war ii in addition to the letter einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with personal envoy to the white house oval office some say that as result of einstein letter and his meetings with roosevelt the us entered the race to develop the bomb drawing on its immense material financial and scientific resources to initiate the manhattan project for einstein war was disease and he called for resistance to war by signing the letter to roosevelt some argue he went against his pacifist principles in year before his death einstein said to his old friend linus pauling made one great mistake in my life when signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made but there was some justification the danger that the germans would make them in einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists including british philosopher bertrand russell signed manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons us citizenship us citizenship certificate from judge phillip forman einstein became an american citizen in not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers and as result individuals were encouraged he said to be more creative trait he valued from his own early education einstein joined the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp in princeton where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans he considered racism america worst disease seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next as part of his involvement he corresponded with civil rights activist du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in when einstein offered to be character witness for du bois the judge decided to drop the case in einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania historically black college where he was awarded an honorary degree lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall einstein gave speech about racism in america adding do not intend to be quiet about it resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for black student personal life assisting zionist causes einstein in einstein was figurehead leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem which opened in and was among its first board of governors earlier in he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization chaim weizmann to help raise funds for the planned university he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs among those he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land that should be followed he suggested by chemical institute and an institute of microbiology to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria which he called an evil that was undermining third of the country development establishing an oriental studies institute to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments was also important chaim weizmann later became israel first president upon his death while in office in november and at the urging of ezriel carlebach prime minister david ben gurion offered einstein the position of president of israel mostly ceremonial post the offer was presented by israel ambassador in washington abba eban who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons einstein declined and wrote in his response that he was deeply moved and at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it love of music einstein right with writer musician and nobel laureate rabindranath tagore einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age in his late journals he wrote if were not physicist would probably be musician often think in music live my daydreams in music see my life in terms of music get most joy in life out of music his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin not only to instill in him love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture according to conductor leon botstein einstein began playing when he was however he did not enjoy it at that age when he turned he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart whereupon he became enamored of mozart compositions and studied music more willingly einstein taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically he said that love is better teacher than sense of duty at age he was heard by school examiner in aarau while playing beethoven violin sonatas the examiner stated afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight what struck the examiner writes botstein was that einstein displayed deep love of the music quality that was and remains in short supply music possessed an unusual meaning for this student music took on pivotal and permanent role in einstein life from that period on although the idea of becoming professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time among those with whom einstein played chamber music were few professionals and he performed for private audiences and friends chamber music had also become regular part of his social life while living in bern zürich and berlin where he played with max planck and his son among others he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the edition of the köchel catalog of mozart work that edition was prepared by alfred einstein who may have been distant relation in while engaged in research at the california institute of technology he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles where he played some of beethoven and mozart works with members of the zoellner quartet near the end of his life when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton he played his violin with them and the quartet was impressed by einstein level of coordination and intonation political and religious views albert einstein with his wife elsa einstein and zionist leaders including future president of israel chaim weizmann his wife vera weizmann menahem ussishkin and ben zion mossinson on arrival in new york city in in einstein was one of the founding members of the german democratic party liberal party however later in his life einstein political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism which he detailed in his essays such as why socialism his opinions on the bolsheviks also changed with time in he criticized them for not having well regulated system of government and called their rule regime of terror and tragedy in human history he later adopted more balanced view criticizing their methods but praising them which is shown by his remark on vladimir lenin in lenin honor man who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice do not find his methods advisable one thing is certain however men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind conscience einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics he strongly advocated the idea of democratic global government that would check the power of nation states in the framework of world federation the fbi created secret dossier on einstein in and by the time of his death his fbi file was pages long einstein was deeply impressed by mahatma gandhi with whom he exchanged written letters he described gandhi as role model for the generations to come einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in wide array of original writings and interviews einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic god of baruch spinoza philosophy he did not believe in personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings view which he described as naïve he clarified however that am not an atheist preferring to call himself an agnostic or deeply religious nonbeliever when asked if he believed in an afterlife einstein replied no and one life is enough for me einstein was primarily affiliated with non religious humanist and ethical culture groups in both the uk and us he served on the advisory board of the first humanist society of new york and was an honorary associate of the rationalist association which publishes new humanist in britain for the th anniversary of the new york society for ethical culture he stated that the idea of ethical culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism he observed without ethical culture there is no salvation for humanity in german language letter to philosopher eric gutkind dated january einstein wrote the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible collection of honorable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions and the jewish people to whom gladly belong and with whose mentality have deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people cannot see anything chosen about them death on april einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in he took the draft of speech he was preparing for television appearance commemorating the state of israel seventh anniversary with him to the hospital but he did not live long enough to complete it einstein refused surgery saying want to go when want it is tasteless to prolong life artificially have done my share it is time to go will do it elegantly he died in princeton hospital early the next morning at the age of having continued to work until near the end during the autopsy the pathologist of princeton hospital thomas stoltz harvey removed einstein brain for preservation without the permission of his family in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent einstein remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location in memorial lecture delivered on december at unesco headquarters nuclear physicist robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as person he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness there was always with him wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn scientific career throughout his life einstein published hundreds of books and articles he published more than scientific papers and non scientific ones on december universities and archives announced the release of einstein papers comprising more than unique documents einstein intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the bose einstein statistics the einstein refrigerator and others annus mirabilis papers the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect which gave rise to quantum theory brownian motion the special theory of relativity and mc that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space time and matter the four papers are title translated area of focus received published significance on heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light photoelectric effect march june resolved an unsolved puzzle by suggesting that energy is exchanged only in discrete amounts quanta this idea was pivotal to the early development of quantum theory on the motion of small particles suspended in stationary liquid as required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat brownian motion may july explained empirical evidence for the atomic theory supporting the application of statistical physics on the electrodynamics of moving bodies special relativity june september reconciled maxwell equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing changes to mechanics resulting from analysis based on empirical evidence that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer discredited the concept of luminiferous ether does the inertia of body depend upon its energy content equivalence september november equivalence of matter and energy and by implication the ability of gravity to bend light the existence of rest energy and the basis of nuclear energy statistical mechanics thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics einstein first paper submitted in to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction it was published in with the title folgerungen aus den which translates as conclusions from the capillarity phenomena two papers he published in thermodynamics attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from statistical point of view these papers were the foundation for the paper on brownian motion which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist his research in and was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena theory of critical opalescence einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving treatment of the density variations in fluid at its critical point ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density at the critical point this derivative is zero leading to large fluctuations the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered making the fluid look milky white einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength and which explains why the sky is blue einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from treatment of density fluctuations and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter special relativity einstein zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies was received on june and published september of that same year it reconciled conflicts between maxwell equations the laws of electricity and magnetism and the laws of newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics observationally the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light the theory developed in this paper later became known as einstein special theory of relativity there is evidence from einstein writings that he collaborated with his first wife mileva marić on this work the decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual but the exact reason is unknown this paper predicted that when measured in the frame of relatively moving observer clock carried by moving body would appear to slow down and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion this paper also argued that the idea of luminiferous aether one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time was superfluous in his paper on mass energy equivalence einstein produced mc as consequence of his special relativity equations einstein work on relativity remained controversial for many years but was accepted by leading physicists starting with max planck einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics the study of moving bodies in hermann minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as theory of spacetime einstein adopted minkowski formalism in his general theory of relativity general relativity general relativity and the equivalence principle eddington photograph of solar eclipse general relativity gr is theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between and according to general relativity the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape as einstein later said the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory while theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion even accelerated ones should appear more satisfactory consequently in he published an article on acceleration under special relativity in that article titled on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it he argued that free fall is really inertial motion and that for free falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply this argument is called the equivalence principle in the same article einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation gravitational redshift and deflection of light in einstein published another article on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light expanding on the article in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies thus the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally gravitational waves in einstein predicted gravitational waves ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves traveling outward from the source transporting energy as gravitational radiation the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it by contrast gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed the first indirect detection of gravitational waves came in the through observation of pair of closely orbiting neutron stars psr the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves einstein prediction was confirmed on february when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves detected on earth on september nearly one hundred years after the prediction hole argument and entwurf theory while developing general relativity einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that general relativistic field theory is impossible he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only in june the entwurf draft theory was the result of these investigations as its name suggests it was sketch of theory less elegant and more difficult than general relativity with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions after more than two years of intensive work einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november physical cosmology millikan and georges lemaître at the california institute of technology in january in einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as whole he discovered that the general field equations predicted universe that was dynamic either contracting or expanding as observational evidence for dynamic universe was not known at the time einstein introduced new term the cosmological constant to the field equations in order to allow the theory to predict static universe the modified field equations predicted static universe of closed curvature in accordance with einstein understanding of mach principle in these years this model became known as the einstein world or einstein static universe following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by edwin hubble in einstein abandoned his static model of the universe and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos the friedmann einstein universe of and the einstein de sitter universe of in each of these models einstein discarded the cosmological constant claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory in many einstein biographies it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim suggesting that it may be exaggerated in late team led by the irish physicist cormac raifeartaigh discovered evidence that shortly after learning of hubble observations of the recession of the nebulae einstein considered steady state model of the universe in hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written in early einstein explored model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to continuous creation of matter process he associated with the cosmological constant as he stated in the paper in what follows would like to draw attention to solution to equation that can account for hubbel sic facts and in which the density is constant over time if one considers physically bounded volume particles of matter will be continually leaving it for the density to remain constant new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space it thus appears that einstein considered steady state model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle bondi and gold however einstein steady state model contained fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea energy momentum pseudotensor general relativity includes dynamical spacetime so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum noether theorem allows these quantities to be determined from lagrangian with translation invariance but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of gauge symmetry the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noether prescriptions do not make real tensor for this reason einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reason the gravitational field could be made to vanish by choice of coordinates he maintained that the non covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in gravitational field this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz and others and has become standard the use of non covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in by erwin schrödinger and others wormholes in einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce model of wormhole often called einstein rosen bridges his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make bridge between two patches if one end of wormhole was positively charged the other end would be negatively charged these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way einstein cartan theory einstein at his office university of berlin in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the torsion this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the equations of motion the theory of general relativity has fundamental lawthe einstein field equations which describe how space curves the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the einstein field equations since the equations of general relativity are non linear lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like black hole would move on trajectory which is determined by the einstein field equations themselves not by new law so einstein proposed that the path of singular solution like black hole would be determined to be geodesic from general relativity itself this was established by einstein infeld and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum and by roy kerr for spinning objects old quantum theory photons and energy quanta the photoelectric effect incoming photons on the left strike metal plate bottom and eject electrons depicted as flying off to the right in paper einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles quanta einstein light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists including max planck and niels bohr this idea only became universally accepted in with robert millikan detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect and with the measurement of compton scattering einstein concluded that each wave of frequency is associated with collection of photons with energy hf each where is planck constant he does not say much more because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results notably the photoelectric effect quantized atomic vibrations in einstein proposed model of matter where each atom in lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator in the einstein model each atom oscillates independently series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics peter debye refined this model adiabatic principle and action angle variables throughout the quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms and the periodic table of the elements einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the arguments wilhelm wien had made wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by simple shifting process einstein noted in that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics bose einstein statistics in einstein received description of statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose based on counting method that assumed that light could be understood as gas of particles einstein noted that bose statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of bose paper to the zeitschrift für physik einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the bose einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures it was not until that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultra cooling equipment built at the nist jila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder bose einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons einstein sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university wave particle duality einstein during his visit to the united states although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in he had not given up on academia in he became privatdozent at the university of bern in über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier paper einstein showed that max planck energy quanta must have well defined momenta and act in some respects as independent point like particles this paper introduced the photon concept although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert lewis in and inspired the notion of wave particle duality in quantum mechanics einstein saw this wave particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed new unified foundation zero point energy in series of works completed from to planck reformulated his quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero point energy in his second quantum theory soon this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero point energy they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data the numbers matched nicely however after publishing the findings they promptly withdrew their support because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero point energy stimulated emission in at the height of his work on relativity einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with planck distribution law if the emission of light into mode with photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws matter waves einstein discovered louis de broglie work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first in another major paper from this era einstein gave wave equation for de broglie waves which einstein suggested was the hamilton jacobi equation of mechanics this paper would inspire schrödinger work of quantum mechanics einstein objections to quantum mechanics newspaper headline on may einstein played major role in developing quantum theory beginning with his paper on the photoelectric effect however he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after despite its acceptance by other physicists he was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism stating that god is not playing at dice until the end of his life he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete bohr versus einstein einstein and niels bohr the bohr einstein debates were series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between einstein and niels bohr who were two of its founders their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics einstein podolsky rosen paradox in einstein returned to quantum mechanics in particular to the question of its completeness in the epr paper in thought experiment he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated no matter how far the two particles were separated precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle likewise precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle without needing to disturb the other particle in any way given einstein concept of local realism there were two possibilities either the other particle had these properties already determined or the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle einstein rejected this second possibility popularly called spooky action at distance einstein belief in local realism led him to assert that while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question it must be incomplete but as physical principle local realism was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of confirmed bell theorem which bell had delineated in the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical like entities each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated although einstein was wrong about local realism his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite entangled quantum states has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the top ten papers published in physical review it is considered centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory unified field theory following his research on general relativity einstein entered into series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include as another aspect of single entity in he described his unified field theory in scientific american article titled on the generalized theory of gravitation although he continued to be lauded for his work einstein became increasingly isolated in his research and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in his pursuit of unification of the fundamental forces einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces which were not well understood until many years after his death mainstream physics in turn largely ignored einstein approaches to unification einstein dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for theory of everything and in particular string theory where geometrical fields emerge in unified quantum mechanical setting other investigations einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned these pertain to force and other research collaboration with other scientists the solvay conference in brussels gathering of the world top physicists einstein is in the center in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld nathan rosen peter bergmann and others einstein also had some one shot collaborations with various scientists einstein de haas experiment einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons nowadays known to be the spin in order to show this they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on torsion pendulum they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate because the electron angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes this experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization schrödinger gas model einstein suggested to erwin schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of bose einstein gas by considering box then to each possible quantum motion of particle in box associate an independent harmonic oscillator quantizing these oscillators each level will have an integer occupation number which will be the number of particles in it this formulation is form of second quantization but it predates modern quantum mechanics erwin schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of semiclassical ideal gas schrödinger urged einstein to add his name as co author although einstein declined the invitation einstein refrigerator in einstein and his former student leó szilárd co invented and in patented the einstein refrigerator this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input on november was awarded to einstein and leó szilárd for the refrigerator their invention was not immediately put into commercial production and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electrolux non scientific legacy heinrich goldschmidt left ole colbjørnsen seated in center and jørgen vogt behind ilse einstein while traveling einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university of jerusalem margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death she died in einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the plumbers and steamfitters union barbara wolff of the hebrew university albert einstein archives told the bbc that there are about pages of private correspondence written between and corbis successor to the roger richman agency licenses the use of his name and associated imagery as agent for the university the einstein rights were litigated in in federal district court in california although the court initially held that the einstein rights had expired that ruling was immediately appealed and the decision was later vacated in its entirety the court initial decision no longer has any legal impact or effect of any kind the underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled the einstein rights are enforceable and the hebrew university of jerusalem is the exclusive representative of those rights in popular culture in the period before world war ii the new yorker published vignette in their the talk of the town feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory he finally figured out way to handle the incessant inquiries he told his inquirers pardon me sorry always am mistaken for professor einstein einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels films plays and works of music he is favorite model for depictions of absent minded professors his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated time magazine frederic golden wrote that einstein was cartoonist dream come true many popular quotations are often misattributed to him awards and honors einstein received numerous awards and honors and in he was awarded the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect none of the nominations in met the criteria set by alfred nobel so the prize was carried forward and awarded to einstein in publications scientific first of series of papers on this topic reprint of this book was published by

afghanistan also pronounced pashto dari pashto dari officially the islamic republic of afghanistan is landlocked country at the crossroads of central and south asia afghanistan is bordered by pakistan to the east and south iran to the west turkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistan to the north and china to the northeast occupying it is mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest kabul is the capital and largest city the population is around million composed mostly of ethnic pashtuns tajiks hazaras and uzbeks humans lived in what is now afghanistan at least years ago settled life emerged in the region years ago evolving gradually into the indus civilization shortugai site the oxus civilization dashlyji site and the helmand civilization mundigak site of the rd millennium bce indo aryans migrated through bactria margiana area to gandhara followed by the rise of the iron age yaz culture ca bce which has been closely associated with the culture depicted in the avesta the ancient religious texts of zoroastrianism the region then known as ariana fell to achaemenid persians in the th century bce who conquered the areas to their east as far as the indus river alexander the great invaded the region in the th century bce who married roxana in bactria before his kabul valley campaign where he faced resistance from aspasioi and assakan tribes the greco bactrian kingdom became the eastern end of the hellenistic world following the conquest by mauryan indians buddhism and hinduism flourished in the region for centuries the kushan emperor kanishka who ruled from his twin capitals of kapiśi and puruṣapura played an important role in the spread of mahayana buddhism to china and central asia various other buddhist and hindu dynasties also ruled the region including the saka kidarite hephthalite alkhon nezak zunbil turk shahi and hindu shahi muslims brought islam to sassanian held herat and zaranj in the mid th century while fuller islamization was achieved between the th and th centuries under the saffarid samanid ghaznavid and ghurid dynasties parts of the region were later ruled by the khwarazmian khalji timurid lodi sur mughal and safavid empires the political history of the modern state of afghanistan began with the hotak dynasty whose founder mirwais hotak declared southern afghanistan independent in in ahmad shah durrani established the durrani empire with its capital at kandahar in the durrani capital was moved to kabul while peshawar became the winter capital the latter was lost to sikhs in in the late th century afghanistan became buffer state in the great game between british india and the russian empire in the first anglo afghan war the british east india company seized control of afghanistan briefly but following the third anglo afghan war in the country was free of foreign influence eventually becoming monarchy under amanullah khan until almost years later when zahir shah was overthrown and republic was established in after second coup afghanistan first became socialist state and then soviet protectorate evoking the soviet afghan war in the against mujahideen rebels by most of the country was captured by the islamic fundamentalist taliban who ruled as totalitarian regime for over five years they were removed from power after the us invasion in but still control significant portion of the country the ongoing war between the government and the taliban has contributed to the perpetuation of afghanistan problematic human rights record including complications of women rights with numerous abuses committed by both sides such as the killing of civilians afghanistan is unitary presidential islamic republic the country has high levels of terrorism poverty child malnutrition and corruption it is member of the united nations the organisation of islamic cooperation the south asian association for regional cooperation the group of the economic cooperation organization and the non aligned movement afghanistan economy is the world th largest with gross domestic product gdp of billion by purchasing power parity the country fares much worse in terms of per capita gdp ppp ranking th out of countries as of etymology the root name afghān is according to some scholars derived from the name of the aśvakan or assakan ancient inhabitants of the hindu kush region aśvakan literally means horsemen horse breeders or cavalrymen from aśva or aspa the sanskrit and avestan words for horse historically the ethnonym afghān was used to refer to ethnic pashtuns the arabic and persian form of the name afġān was first attested in the th century geography book hudud al alam the last part of the name stan is persian suffix for place of therefore afghanistan translates to land of the afghans or land of the pashtuns in historical sense the modern constitution of afghanistan however states that the word afghan shall apply to every citizen of afghanistan history tents of afghan nomads in the northern badghis province of afghanistan early peasant farming villages came into existence in afghanistan about years ago many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in afghanistan such as the greco bactrians sakas kushans kidarites hephthalites alkhons nezaks zunbils turk shahis hindu shahis lawiks saffarids samanids ghaznavids ghurids khwarazmians khaljis kartids timurids lodis surs mughals and safavids and finally the hotak and durrani dynasties which marked the political origins of the modern state throughout millennia several cities within the modern day afghanistan served as capitals of various empires namely bactra balkh alexandria on the oxus ai khanoum kapisi sigal kabul kunduz zaranj firozkoh herat ghazna ghazni binban bamyan and kandahar the country sits at unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought it has been home to various peoples through the ages among them the ancient iranian peoples who established the dominant role of indo iranian languages in the region at multiple points the land has been incorporated within vast regional empires among them the achaemenid empire the macedonian empire the indian maurya empire and the islamic empire for its success in resisting foreign occupation during the th and th centuries afghanistan has been called the graveyard of empires though it is unknown who coined the phrase prehistory and antiquity excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now afghanistan at least years ago and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world an important site of early historical activities many believe that afghanistan compares to egypt in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites the extent of the upright archaeological exploration done in the th century suggests that the geographical area of afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east west and north artifacts typical of the paleolithic mesolithic neolithic bronze and iron ages have been found in afghanistan urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as bce and the early city of mundigak near kandahar in the south of the country was center of the helmand culture more recent findings established that the indus valley civilisation stretched up towards modern day afghanistan making the ancient civilization today part of pakistan afghanistan and india in more detail it extended from what today is northwest pakistan to northwest india and northeast afghanistan an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in northern afghanistan there are several smaller ivc colonies to be found in afghanistan as well after bce successive waves of semi nomadic people from central asia began moving south into afghanistan among them were many indo european speaking indo iranians these tribes later migrated further into south asia western asia and toward europe via the area north of the caspian sea the region at the time was referred to as ariana zoroastrianism and hellenic era bactrian gold scythian belt depicing dionysus from tillya tepe in the

britain gained control of afghanistan foreign relations as part of the treaty of gandamak of in mortimer durand made amir abdur rahman khan sign controversial agreement in which the ethnic pashtun and baloch territories were divided by the durand line this was standard divide and rule policy of the british and would lead to strained relations especially with the later new state of pakistan shia dominated hazarajat and pagan kafiristan remained politically independent until being conquered by abdur rahman khan in he was known as the iron amir for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes the iron amir viewed railway and telegraph lines coming from the russian and british empires as trojan horses and therefore prevented railway development in afghanistan he died in replaced by his son habibullah khan during world war when afghanistan was neutral habibullah khan was met by officials of the central powers in the niedermayer hentig expedition to declare full independence from the united kingdom join them and attack british india as part of the hindu german conspiracy their efforts to bring afghanistan into the central powers failed but it caused discontent among the population for keeping neutrality against the british habibullah was assassinated during hunting trip in and amanullah khan eventually assumed power staunch supporter of the expeditions amanullah khan evoked the third anglo afghan war entering british india via the khyber pass king amanullah khan invaded british india in and proclaimed afghanistan full independence thereafter after the end third anglo afghan war and the signing of the treaty of rawalpindi on august king amanullah khan declared afghanistan sovereign and fully independent state he moved to end his country traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community particularly with the soviet union and the weimar republic of germany following tour of europe and turkey he introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation key force behind these reforms was mahmud tarzi an ardent supporter of the education of women he fought for article of afghanistan constitution which made elementary education compulsory the institution of slavery was abolished in khan wife queen soraya tarzi was figure during this period some of the reforms that were put in place such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of several co educational schools quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders and this led to the afghan civil war faced with the overwhelming armed opposition amanullah khan abdicated in january and soon after kabul fell to saqqawist forces led by habibullah kalakani prince mohammed nadir shah amanullah cousin in turn defeated and killed kalakani in october and was declared king nadir shah he abandoned the reforms of amanullah khan in favor of more gradual approach to modernization but was assassinated in by abdul khaliq fifteen year old hazara student who was an amanullah loyalist mohammed zahir shah nadir shah year old son succeeded to the throne and reigned from to the tribal revolts of saw zahir shah reign being challenged by zadran safi mangal and wazir tribesmen led by mazrak zadran salemai and mirzali khan among others many of whom were amanullah loyalists close relations with the muslim states turkey the kingdom of iraq and iran persia were also pursued while further international relations were sought by joining the league of nations in the saw the development of roads infrastructure the founding of national bank and increased education road links in the north played large part in growing cotton and textile industry the country built close relationships with the axis powers with germany having the largest share in afghan development at the time along with italy and japan contemporary history zahir shah the last king of afghanistan who reigned from to until zahir shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle who held the post of prime minister and continued the policies of nadir shah another of zahir shah uncles shah mahmud khan became prime minister in and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected he was replaced in by mohammed daoud khan the king cousin and brother in law and pashtun nationalist who sought the creation of pashtunistan leading to highly tense relations with pakistan during his ten years at the post until daoud khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought closer relationship with the soviet union afterward the constitution was formed and the first non royal prime minister was sworn in king zahir shah like his father nadir shah had policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization creating nationalist feeling and improving relations with the united kingdom however afghanistan remained neutral and was neither participant in world war ii nor aligned with either power bloc in the cold war thereafter however it was beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the soviet union and the united states vied for influence by building afghanistan main highways airports and other vital infrastructure in the post period on per capita basis afghanistan received more soviet development aid than any other country afghanistan had therefore good relations with both cold war enemies in while the king was in italy daoud khan launched bloodless coup and became the first president of afghanistan abolishing the monarchy democratic republic regime and soviet war in april the communist people democratic party of afghanistan pdpa seized power in bloody coup état against then president mohammed daoud khan in what is called the saur revolution the pdpa declared the establishment of the democratic republic of afghanistan with its first leader named as people democratic party general secretary nur muhammad taraki this would trigger series of events that would dramatically turn afghanistan from poor and secluded albeit peaceful country to hotbed of international terrorism the pdpa initiated various social symbolic and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition while also brutally oppressing political dissidents this caused unrest and quickly expanded into state of civil war by waged by guerrilla mujahideen and smaller maoist guerillas against regime forces countrywide it quickly turned into proxy war as the pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers the united states supported them through pakistan inter services intelligence isi and the soviet union sent thousands of military advisers to support the pdpa regime meanwhile there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the pdpa the dominant khalq and the more moderate parcham in september pdpa general secretary taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by fellow khalq member then prime minister hafizullah amin who assumed the new general secretary of the people democratic party the situation in the country deteriorated under amin and thousands of people went missing displeased with amin government the soviet army invaded the country in december heading for kabul and killing amin just days later soviet organized regime led by parcham babrak karmal but inclusive of both factions parcham and khalq filled the vacuum soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize afghanistan under karmal marking the beginning of the soviet afghan war the united states and pakistan along with smaller actors like saudi arabia and china continued supporting the rebels delivering billions of dollars in cash and weapons including two thousand fim stinger surface to air missiles lasting nine years the war caused the deaths of between and million afghans and displaced about million people who subsequently fled

pakistan who soon had military support from pakistan taking control of kandahar city that year they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of rabbani from kabul in where they established an emirate that gained international recognition from only three countries the taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of islamic sharia law which resulted in the brutal treatment of many afghans especially women during their rule the taliban and their allies committed massacres against afghan civilians denied un food supplies

many offensives against the taliban but failed to fully defeat them afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world due to lack of foreign investment government corruption and the taliban insurgency meanwhile karzai attempted to unite the peoples of the country and the afghan government was able to build some democratic structures adopting constitution in with the name islamic

and morphological conditions defined in an area of it possesses significant diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow capped mountains in the albanian alps as well as the korab skanderbeg pindus and ceraunian mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the albanian adriatic and ionian sea along the mediterranean sea historically albania has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the illyrians thracians ancient greeks romans byzantines venetians and ottomans the albanians established the autonomous principality of arbër in the th century the kingdom of albania and principality of albania formed between the th and th centuries prior to the ottoman conquest of albania in the th century the albanian resistance to ottoman expansion into europe led by gjergj kastrioti skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of europe between the th and th centuries cultural developments widely attributed to albanians having gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength conclusively led to the albanian renaissance after the defeat of the ottomans in the balkan wars the modern nation state of albania declared independence in in the th century the kingdom of albania was invaded by italy which formed greater albania before becoming protectorate of nazi germany enver hoxha formed communist albania after the second world war and launched the albanians on path of oppression and decades of isolation the revolutions of concluded the fall of communism in albania and eventually the establishment of the current republic of albania politically albania is unitary parliamentary constitutional republic and developing country with an upper middle income economy dominated by the service sector followed by manufacturing it went through process of transition following the end of communism in from centralized planning to market based economy albania provides universal health care and free primary and secondary education to its citizens albania is member of the united nations world bank unesco nato wto coe osce and oic it is an official candidate for membership in the european union it is one of the founding members of the energy community including the organization of the black sea economic cooperation and union for the mediterranean etymology the term albania is the medieval latin name of the country it may be derived from the illyrian tribe of albani recorded by ptolemy the geographer and astronomer from alexandria who drafted map in ad which shows the city of albanopolis located northeast of durrës the term may have continuation in the name of medieval settlement called albanon or arbanon although it is not certain that this was the same place in his history written in the th century the byzantine historian michael attaliates was the first to refer to albanoi as having taken part in revolt against constantinople in and to the arbanitai as subjects of the duke of dyrrachium during the middle ages the albanians called their country and referred to themselves as nowadays albanians call their country the words shqipëri and shqiptar are attested from th century onward but it was only at the end of th and beginning of the early th centuries that the placename shqipëria and the ethnic demonym shqiptarë gradually replaced arbëria and arbëreshë amongst albanian speakers the two terms are popularly interpreted as land of the eagles and children of the eagles history prehistory the remains of kamenica tumulus in the county of korçë the first attested traces of neanderthal presence in the territory of albania dates back to the middle and upper paleolithic period and were discovered in xarrë and at mount dajt in the adjacent region of tirana archaeological sites from this period include the kamenica tumulus konispol cave and pellumbas cave the discovered objects in cave near xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilised animal bones while those discoveries at mount dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the aurignacian culture they also demonstrate notable similarities with objects of the equivalent period found at crvena stijena in montenegro and northwestern greece multiple artefacts from the iron and bronze ages near tumulus burials have been unearthed in central and southern albania which has similar affinity with the sites in southwestern macedonia and lefkada archaeologists have come to the conclusion that these regions were inhabited from the middle of the third millennium bc by indo european people who spoke proto greek language hence part of this historical population later moved to mycenae around bc and properly established the mycenaean civilisation antiquity founded in the th century bc scodra was an significant city of the illyrian tribes of the ardiaei and labeates in ancient times the incorporated territory of albania was historically inhabited by indo european peoples among them numerous illyrian tribes ancient greeks and thracians in view of the illyrian tribes there is no evidence that these tribes used any collective nomenclature for themselves while it is regarded to be unlikely that they used common endonym the endonym illyrians seems to be the name applied to specific illyrian tribe which was the first to come in liaison with the ancient greeks resulting the endonym illyrians to be applied pars pro toto to all people of similar language and customs apollonia was an important ancient greek colony on the illyrian coast along the adriatic sea and one of the western points of the via egnatia route that connected rome and constantinople the territory referred to as illyria corresponded roughly to the area east of the adriatic sea in the mediterranean sea extending in the south to the mouth of the vjosë the first account of the illyrian groups comes from periplus of the euxine sea an ancient greek text written in the middle of the th century bc the west was inhabited by the thracian tribe of the bryges while the south was inhabited by the ancient greek speaking tribe of the chaonians whose capital was at phoenice other colonies such as apollonia epidamnos and amantia were established by ancient greek city states on the coast by the th century bc the illyrian ardiaei tribe centered in montenegro ruled over most of the territory of albania their ardiaean kingdom reached its greatest extent under king agron the son of pleuratus ii agron extended his rule over other neighboring tribes as well following agron death in bc his wife teuta inherited the ardiaean kingdom teuta forces extended their operations further southward to the ionian sea in bc rome declared war on the kingdom for extensively plundering roman ships the war ended in illyrian defeat in bc teuta was eventually succeeded by gentius in bc gentius clashed with the romans in bc initiating the third illyrian war the conflict resulted in roman conquest of the region by bc the romans split the region into three administrative divisions middle ages the town of krujë was the capital of the principality of arbanon in the middle ages the roman empire was split in upon the death of theodosius into an eastern and western roman empire in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the barbarian invasions from the th century into the th century the slavs crossed the danube and largely absorbed the indigenous ancient greeks illyrians and thracians in the balkans thus the illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the th century in the th century the great schism formalised the break of communion between the eastern orthodox and western catholic church that is reflected in albania through the emergence of catholic north and orthodox south the albanian people inhabited the west of lake ochrida and the upper valley of river shkumbin and established the principality of arbanon in under the leadership of progon of kruja the realm was succeeded by his sons gjin and dhimitri upon the death of dhimiter the territory came under the rule of the albanian greek gregory kamonas and subsequently under the golem of kruja in the th century the principality was dissolved arbanon is considered to be the first sketch of an albanian state that retained semi autonomous status as the western extremity of the byzantine empire under the byzantine doukai of epirus or laskarids of nicaea relief of the scuola degli albanesi commemorating the siege of shkodra it illustrates sultan mehmet ii laying siege to the albanian town of scutari then part of venetian empire towards the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries serbs and venetians started to take possession over the territory the ethnogenesis of the albanians is uncertain however the first undisputed mention of albanians dates back in historical records from or in work by michael attaliates who referred to the albanoi as having taken part in revolt against constantinople at this point the albanians were fully christianized few years after the dissolution of arbanon charles of anjou concluded an agreement with the albanian rulers promising to protect them and their ancient liberties in he established the kingdom of albania and conquered regions back from the despotate of epirus the kingdom claimed all of central albania territory from dyrrhachium along the adriatic sea coast down to butrint catholic political structure was basis for the papal plans of spreading catholicism in the balkan peninsula this plan found also the support of helen of anjou cousin of charles of anjou around catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern albania internal power struggles within the byzantine empire in the th century enabled serbs most powerful medieval ruler stefan dusan to establish short lived empire that included all of albania except durrës in various albanian rulers established the despotate of arta during that time several albanian principalities were created notably the balsha thopia kastrioti muzaka and arianiti in the first half of the th century the ottoman empire invaded most of albania and the league of lezhë was held under skanderbeg as ruler who became the national hero of the albanian medieval history ottoman empire after serving the ottoman empire for nearly years gjergj kastrioti skanderbeg deserted and began rebellion against the empire that halted ottoman advance into europe for years with the fall of constantinople the ottoman empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into southeast europe they reached the albanian ionian sea coast in and erected their garrisons across southern albania in and then occupied most of albania in thousands of albanians consequently fled to western europe particularly to calabria naples ragusa and sicily whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible mountains of albania the albanians as christians were considered as an inferior class of people and as such they were subjected to heavy taxes among others by the devshirme system that allowed the sultan to collect requisite percentage of christian adolescents from their families to compose the janissary the ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of islamisation and the rapid construction of mosques which consequently modified the religious picture of albania prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the assembly of lezhë until the siege of shkodër under the leadership of gjergj kastrioti skanderbeg multiple times defeating major ottoman armies led by sultans murad ii and mehmed ii skanderbeg managed to gather several of the albanian principals amongst them the arianitis dukagjinis zaharias and thopias and establish centralised authority over most of the non conquered territories becoming the lord of albania skanderbeg consistently pursued the goal relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to constitute european coalition

into the th century islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the ottoman empire however motives for conversion were according to some scholars diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues because of increasing suppression of catholicism mostly catholic albanians converted in the th century while orthodox albanians followed suit mainly in the following century since the albanians were seen as strategically important they made up significant proportion of the ottoman military and bureaucracy couple of muslim albanians attained important political and military positions who culturally contributed to the broader muslim world enjoying this privileged position they held various high administrative

ethnicity are delicate topic and subject to debate contrary to official statistics that show an over per cent albanian majority in the country minority groups such as greeks macedonians montenegrins roma and aromanians have frequently disputed the official numbers asserting higher percentage of the country population according to the disputed census ethnic affiliation was as follows albanians of the total greeks macedonians montenegrins aromanians romani balkan egyptians other ethnicities no declared ethnicity and not relevant on the quality of the specific data the advisory committee on the framework convention for the protection of national minorities stated that the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities albania recognises nine national or cultural minorities greek macedonian wallachian montenegrin serb roma egyptian bosnian and bulgarian peoples other albanian minorities are gorani aromanians and jews regarding the greeks it is difficult to know how many greeks there are in albania the estimates vary between and ethnic greeks in albania according to ian jeffries most of western sources put the number at around the mark is supported by greek government as well the cia world factbook estimates the greek minority to constitute of the total population the us state department estimates that greeks make up and other minorities of the population the latter questions the validity of the census data about the greek minority due to the fact that measurements have been affected by boycott macedonians and some greek minority groups have sharply criticised article of the census law according to which fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate this is claimed to be an attempt to intimidate minorities into declaring albanian ethnicity according to them the albanian government has stated that it will jail anyone who does not participate in the census or refuse to declare his or her ethnicity genc pollo the minister in charge has declared that albanian citizens will be able to freely express their ethnic and religious affiliation and mother tongue however they are not forced to answer these sensitive questions the amendments criticized do not include jailing or forced declaration of ethnicity or religion only fine is envisioned which can be overthrown by court greek representatives form part of the albanian parliament and the government has invited albanian greeks to register as the only way to improve their status on the other hand nationalists various organisations and political parties in albania have expressed their concern that the census might artificially increase the numbers of the greek minority which might be then exploited by greece to threaten albania territorial integrity language the dialects of the albanian language in albania the official language of the country is albanian which is spoken by the vast majority of the country

or of the population declared albanian as their mother tongue mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood in recent years the shrinking number of pupils in schools dedicated to the greek minority has caused problems for teachers the greek language is spoken by an important percentage in the southern part of the country due to cultural and economic links

with and greek with among young people aged or less english german and turkish have seen rising interest after italian and french have had stable interest while greek has lost much of its previous interest the trends are linked with cultural and economic factors greek is the second most spoken language in the country with to of the population speaking it as first language and with two thirds of mainly albanian families having at least one member that speaks greek most having learned it in the post communist era present due to private schools or migration to greece outside of the small designated minority area in the south the teaching of greek was banned during the communist era as of greek was offered at over private tutoring centers all over albania and at private school in tirana the first of its kind outside greece young people have shown growing interest in german language in recent years some of them go to germany for studying or various experiences albania and germany have agreements for cooperating in helping young people of the two countries know both cultures better due to sharp rise in economic relations with turkey interest in learning turkish in

they were mostly christianised islam arrived for the first time in the late th century to the region when arabs raided parts of the eastern banks of the adriatic sea it later emerged as the majority religion during centuries of ottoman rule though significant christian minority remained during modern times the albanian republican monarchic and later communist regimes followed systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life the country has never had an official religion either as republic or as kingdom in the th century the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the and under the state policy of obliterating all organised religion from the territories of albania the communist regime persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion the country was then officially declared to be the world first atheist state religious freedom has returned however since the end of communism islam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era as practised religion in albania some smaller christian sects in albania include evangelicals and several protestant communities including seventh day adventist church church of jesus christ of latter day saints and jehovah witnesses the first recorded protestant of albania was said toptani who travelled around

faiths the albanian orthodox church officially refused to recognize the results claiming that of the total population adhered to its faith some muslim community officials expressed unhappiness with the data claiming that many muslims were not counted and that the number of adherents numbered some of the albanian population the albanian catholic bishops conference also cast doubts on the census

arabic calligraphy allah is the arabic word for god in abrahamic religions in the english language the word generally refers to god in islam the word is thought to be derived by contraction from al ilāh which means the god and is linguistically related to el elohim and elah the hebrew and aramaic words for god the word allah has been used by arabic people of different religions since pre islamic times more specifically it has been used as term for god by muslims both arab and non arab and arab christians it is also often albeit not exclusively used in this way by bábists baháʼís mandaeans indonesian and maltese christians and mizrahi jews similar usage by christians and sikhs in west malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies etymology the arabic components that build up the word allah the etymology of the word allāh has been discussed extensively by classical arab philologists grammarians of the basra school regarded it as either formed spontaneously murtajal or as the definite form of lāh from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of lofty or hidden others held that it was borrowed from syriac or hebrew but most considered it to be derived from contraction of the arabic definite article al the and deity god to meaning the deity or the god the majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism cognates of the name allāh exist in other semitic languages including hebrew and aramaic the corresponding aramaic form is elah but its emphatic state is elaha it is written as ʼĕlāhā in biblical aramaic and ʼalâhâ in syriac as used by the assyrian church both meaning simply god biblical hebrew mostly uses the plural but functional singular form elohim but more rarely it also uses the singular form eloah usage pre islamic arabians regional variants of the word allah occur in both pagan and christian pre islamic inscriptions different theories have been proposed regarding the role of allah in pre islamic polytheistic cults some authors have suggested that polytheistic arabs used the name as reference to creator god or supreme deity of their pantheon the term may have been vague in the meccan religion according to one hypothesis which goes back to julius wellhausen allah the supreme deity of the tribal federation around quraysh was designation that consecrated the superiority of hubal the supreme deity of quraysh over the other gods however there is also evidence that allah and hubal were two distinct deities according to that hypothesis the kaaba was first consecrated to supreme deity named allah and then hosted the pantheon of quraysh after their conquest of mecca about century before the time of muhammad some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of allah as name of polytheist deity centuries earlier but nothing precise is known about this use some scholars have suggested that allah may have represented remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities there is disagreement on whether allah played major role in the meccan religious cult no iconic representation of allah is known to have existed allah is the only god in mecca that did not have an idol muhammad father name was meaning the slave of allāh christianity arabic speakers of all abrahamic faiths including christians and jews use the word allah to mean god the christian arabs of today have no other word for god than allah similarly the aramaic word for god in the language of assyrian christians is ʼĕlāhā or alaha even the arabic descended maltese language of malta whose population is almost entirely catholic uses alla for god arab christians for example use the terms for god the father for god the son and for god the holy spirit see god in christianity for the christian concept of god arab christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works they adopted the muslim and also created their own trinitized as early as the th century the muslim reads in the name of god the compassionate the merciful the trinitized reads in the name of father and the son and the holy spirit one god the syriac latin and greek invocations do not have the words one god at the end this addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to muslims according to marshall hodgson it seems that in the pre islamic times some arab christians made pilgrimage to the kaaba pagan temple at that time honoring allah there as god the creator some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient pre islamic inscriptions and tombs made by arab christians in the ruins of church at umm el jimal in northern jordan which initially according to enno littman contained references to allah as the proper name of god however on second revision by bellamy et al the versed inscription was re translated as this inscription was set up by colleagues of ʿulayh son of ʿubaydah secretary of the cohort augusta secunda philadelphiana may he go mad who effaces it the syriac word ܐܠܗܐ ʼĕlāhā can be found in the reports and the lists of names of christian martyrs in south arabia as reported by antique syriac documents of the names of those martyrs from the era of the himyarite and aksumite kingdoms in ibn ishaq biography there is christian leader named abd allah ibn abu bakr ibn muhammad who was martyred in najran in as he had worn ring that said allah is my lord in an inscription of christian martyrion dated back to references to ilah الاله can be found in both arabic and aramaic the inscription starts with the statement by the help of ilah in pre islamic gospels the name used for god was allah as evidenced by some discovered arabic versions of the new testament written by arab christians during the pre islamic era in northern and southern arabia however most recent research in the field of islamic studies by sydney griffith et al david grafton clair wilde ml hjälm et al assert that all one can say about the possibility of pre islamic christian version of the gospel in arabic is that no sure sign of its actual existence has yet emerged additionally ml hjälm in her most recent research inserts that manuscripts containing translations of the gospels are encountered no earlier than the year irfan shahîd quoting the th century encyclopedic collection kitab al aghani notes that pre islamic arab christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry ya la ibad allah slaves of allah to invoke each other into battle according to shahid on the authority of th century muslim scholar al marzubani allah was also mentioned in pre islamic christian poems by some ghassanid and tanukhid poets in syria and northern arabia islam medallion showing allah jalla jalaluhu in the hagia sophia istanbul turkey old mosque in edirne turkey in islam allah is the unique omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to god in other abrahamic religions allah is usually seen as the personal name of god notion which became disputed in contemporary scholarship including the question whether or not the word allah should be translated as god according to islamic belief allah is the most common word to represent god and humble submission to his will divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the muslim faith he is the only god creator of the universe and the judge of humankind he is unique and inherently one all merciful and omnipotent the qur an declares the reality of allah his inaccessible mystery his various names and his actions on behalf of his creatures the concept correlates to the tawhid where the last chapter of the qur an the th surah of al ikhlās the sincerity reads say he is allah who is one al wāḥid allah the eternal refuge al aḥad he neither begets nor is born nor is there to him any equivalent and in the ayat ul kursi verse of the throne which is the th verse and the powerful verse in the longest chapter the nd chapter of the qur an al baqarah the cow states allah there is no deity but him the alive the eternal neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh him unto him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth who could intercede in his presence without his permission he knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them while they encompass nothing of his knowledge except what he wills his throne includeth the heavens and the earth and he is never weary of preserving them he is the sublime the tremendous in islamic tradition there are names of god lit meaning the best names or the most beautiful names each of which evoke distinct characteristic of allah all these names refer to allah the supreme and all comprehensive divine name among the names of god the most famous and most frequent of these names are the merciful ar raḥmān and the compassionate including the forementioned above al aḥad the one the indivisible and al wāḥid the unique the single most muslims use the untranslated arabic phrase meaning if god wills after references to future events muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of meaning in the name of god there are certain phrases in praise of god that are favored by muslims including glory be to god praise be to god there is no deity but god or sometimes lā ilāha illā inta huwa there is no deity but you him and god is the most great as devotional exercise of remembering god dhikr in sufi practice known as dhikr allah arabic ذكر الله lit remembrance of god the sufi repeats and contemplates the name allah or other associated divine names to him while controlling his or her breath for example in countless references in the context from the qur an forementioned above allah is referred to in the second person pronoun in arabic as inta arabic like the english you or commonly in the third person pronoun huwa arabic like the english he and uniquely in the case pronoun of the oblique form hu huw arabic هو like the english him which rhythmically resonates and is chanted as considered sacred sound or echo referring allah as the absolute breath or soul of life al nafs al hayyah arabic الن فس الحياة an nafsu ḥayyah notably among the names of god the giver of life al muḥyī and the bringer of death al mumiyt allah is neither male or female who has no gender but who is the essence of the omnipotent selfless absolute soul an nafs الن فس and holy spirit ar rūḥ الر وح notably among the names of god the all holy all pure and all sacred al quddus allah is the originator of both before and beyond the cycle of creation destruction and time notably among the names of god the first beginning less al awwal the end beyond the final abode endless al akhir al ākhir and the timeless aṣ ṣabūr according to gerhard böwering in contrast with pre islamic arabian polytheism god in islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between god and jinn pre islamic pagan arabs believed in blind powerful inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control this was replaced with the islamic notion of powerful but provident and merciful god according to francis edward peters the qur ān insists muslims believe and historians affirm that muhammad and his followers worship the same god as the jews the qur an allah is the same creator god who covenanted with abraham peters states that the qur an portrays allah as both more powerful and more remote than yahweh and as universal deity unlike yahweh who closely follows israelites pronunciation the word allāh is generally pronounced exhibiting heavy lām velarized alveolar lateral approximant marginal phoneme in modern standard arabic since the initial alef has no hamza the initial is elided when preceding word ends in vowel if the preceding vowel is the lām is light as in for instance the basmala as loanword english and other european languages the history of the name allāh in english was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the th century for example thomas carlyle sometimes used the term allah but without any implication that allah was anything different from god however in his biography of muḥammad tor andræ always used the term allah though he allows that this conception of god seems to imply that it is different from that of the jewish and christian theologies languages which may not commonly use the term allah to denote god may still contain popular expressions which use the word for example because of the centuries long muslim presence in the iberian peninsula the word ojalá in the spanish language and oxalá in the portuguese language exist today borrowed from arabic inshalla arabic إن شاء الله this phrase literally means if god wills in the sense of hope so the german poet mahlmann used the form allah as the title of poem about the ultimate deity though it is unclear how much islamic thought he intended to convey some muslims leave the name allāh untranslated in english rather than using the english translation god the word has also been applied to certain living human beings as of the term and concept malaysian and indonesian language ruyl justus heurnius and caspar wiltens in recorded allah as the translation of the dutch word godt gereja kalam kebangunan allah word of god revival church in indonesia allah is the word for god in the indonesian language even in alkitab christian bible from الكتاب al kitāb the book translations while tuhan is the word for lord christians in malaysia also use the word allah for god christians in malaysia and indonesia use allah to refer to god in the malaysian and indonesian languages both of them standardized forms of the malay language mainstream bible translations in the language use allah as the translation of hebrew elohim translated in english bibles as god this goes back to early translation work by francis xavier in the th century the first dictionary of dutch malay by albert cornelius ruyl justus heurnius and caspar wiltens in revised edition from edition and latin edition recorded allah as the translation of the dutch word godt ruyl also translated the gospel of matthew in into the malay language an early bible translation into non european language made year after the publication of the king james version which was printed in the netherlands in then he translated the gospel of mark published in the government of malaysia in outlawed usage of the term allah in any other but muslim contexts but the malayan high court in revoked the law ruling it while allah had been used for the christian god in malay for more than four centuries the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of allah by the roman catholic newspaper the herald the government appealed the court ruling and the high court suspended implementation of its verdict until the hearing of the appeal in october the court ruled in favor of the government ban in early the malaysian government confiscated more than bibles for using the word to refer to the christian god in peninsular malaysia however the use of allah is not prohibited in the two malaysian states of sabah and sarawak the main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long established and local alkitab bibles have been widely distributed freely in east malaysia without restrictions for years both states also do not have similar islamic state laws as those in west malaysia in reaction to some media criticism the malaysian government has introduced point solution to avoid confusion and misleading information the point solution is in line with the spirit of the and point agreements of

russian empire in and became the first secular democratic muslim majority state in the country was incorporated into the soviet union as the azerbaijan soviet socialist republic the modern republic of azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on august shortly before the dissolution of the ussr in the same year in september the armenian majority of the disputed nagorno karabakh region seceded to form the republic of artsakh the region and seven surrounding districts internationally recognized as part of azerbaijan pending solution to the status of the nagorno karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the osce became de facto independent with the end of the first nagorno karabakh war in following the nagorno karabakh war the seven districts and parts of nagorno karabakh were returned to azerbaijani rule azerbaijan is unitary semi presidential republic it is one of six independent turkic states and an active member of the turkic council and the türksoy community azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with countries and holds membership in international organizations including the united nations since the council of europe the non aligned movement the osce and the nato partnership for peace pfp program it is one of the founding members of guam the commonwealth of independent states cis and the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons azerbaijan also holds observer status in the world trade organization while around of the population is muslim the constitution of azerbaijan does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist azerbaijan is developing country and ranks th on the human development index it has high rate of economic development and literacy as well as low rate of unemployment however the ruling party the new azerbaijan party in power since has been accused of authoritarian leadership and the deterioration of the country human rights record including increasing restrictions on civil liberties particularly on press freedom and political repression etymology according to modern etymology the term azerbaijan derives from that of atropates persian satrap under the achaemenid empire who was later reinstated as the satrap of media under alexander the great the original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once dominant zoroastrianism in the avesta frawardin yasht hymn to the guardian angels there is mention of âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide which literally translates from avestan as we worship the fravashi of the holy atropatene the name atropates itself is the greek transliteration of an old iranian probably median compounded name with the meaning protected by the holy fire or the land of the holy fire the greek name was mentioned by diodorus siculus and strabo over the span of millennia the name evolved to middle persian then to new persian and present day azerbaijan the name azerbaijan was first adopted for the area of the present day republic of azerbaijan by the government of musavat in after the collapse of the russian empire when the independent azerbaijan democratic republic was established until then the designation had been used exclusively to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern iran while the area of the azerbaijan democratic republic was formerly referred to as arran and shirvan on that basis iran protested the newly adopted country name during the soviet rule the country was also spelled in latin from the russian transliteration as azerbaydzhan the country name was also spelled in cyrillic script from to as азәрбајҹан history antiquity petroglyphs in gobustan national park dating back to the th millennium bc indicating thriving culture it is unesco world heritage site considered to be of outstanding universal value the earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of azerbaijan dates back to the late stone age and is related to the guruchay culture of azokh cave early settlements included the scythians during the th century bc following the scythians iranian medes came to dominate the area to the south of the aras river the medes forged vast empire between and bc which was integrated into the achaemenid empire around bc the area was conquered by the achaemenids leading to the spread of zoroastrianism from the sasanid period to the safavid period the sasanian empire turned caucasian albania into vassal state in while king urnayr officially adopted christianity as the state religion in the th century despite sassanid rule albania remained an entity in the region until the th century while fully subordinate to sassanid iran and retained its monarchy despite being one of the chief vassals of the sasanian emperor the albanian king had only semblance of authority and the sasanian marzban military governor held most civil religious and military authority in the first half of the th century caucasian albania as vassal of the sasanians came under nominal muslim rule due to the muslim conquest of persia the umayyad caliphate repulsed both the sasanians and byzantines from transcaucasia and turned caucasian albania into vassal state after christian resistance led by king javanshir was suppressed in the power vacuum left by the decline of the abbasid caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the sallarids sajids and shaddadids at the beginning of the th century the territory was gradually seized by the waves of oghuz turks from central asia who adopted turkoman ethnonym at the time the first of these turkic dynasties established was the seljuk empire who entered the area now known as azerbaijan by the pre turkic population that lived on the territory of modern azerbaijan spoke several indo european and caucasian languages among them armenian and an iranian language old azeri which was gradually replaced by turkic language the early precursor of the azerbaijani language of today some linguists have also stated that the tati dialects of iranian azerbaijan and the republic of azerbaijan like those spoken by the tats are descended from old azeri locally the possessions of the subsequent seljuk empire were ruled by eldiguzids technically vassals of the seljuk sultans but sometimes de facto rulers themselves under the seljuks local poets such as nizami ganjavi and khaqani gave rise to blossoming of persian literature on the territory of present day azerbaijan the local dynasty of the shirvanshahs became vassal state of timur empire and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the golden horde tokhtamysh following timur death two independent and rival states emerged kara koyunlu and aq qoyunlu the shirvanshahs returned maintaining for numerous centuries to come high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals as they had done since in the safavid dynasty of iran subdued the shirvanshahs and gained its possessions in the course of the next century the safavids converted the formerly sunni population to shia islam as they did with the population in what is modern day iran the safavids allowed the shirvanshahs to remain in power under safavid suzerainty until when safavid king tahmasp completely deposed them and made the area into the safavid province of shirvan the sunni ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present day azerbaijan as result of the ottoman safavid war of by the early th century they were ousted by safavid iranian ruler abbas in the wake of the demise of the safavid empire baku and its environs were briefly occupied by the russians as consequence of the russo persian war of despite brief intermissions such as these by safavid iran neighboring rivals the land of what is today azerbaijan remained under iranian rule from the earliest advent of the safavids up to the course of the th century contemporary history territories of the khanates and sultanates in the th th century after the safavids the area was ruled by the iranian afsharid dynasty after the death of nader shah many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability numerous self ruling khanates with various forms of autonomy emerged in the area the rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of iran and were vassals and subjects of the iranian shah the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west thereafter the area was under the successive rule of the iranian zands and qajars from the late th century imperial russia switched to more aggressive geo political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south namely iran and the ottoman empire russia now actively tried to gain possession of the caucasus region which was for the most part in the hands of iran in the russians invaded and sacked the iranian town of ganja sparking the russo persian war of the militarily superior russians ended the russo persian war of with victory the siege of ganja fortress in during the russo persian war of following qajar iran loss in the war it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates along with georgia and dagestan to the russian empire per the treaty of gulistan the area to the north of the river aras amongst which territory lies the contemporary republic of azerbaijan was iranian territory until it was occupied by russia in the th century about decade later in violation of the gulistan treaty the russians invaded iran erivan khanate this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two the russo persian war of the resulting treaty of turkmenchay forced qajar iran to cede sovereignty over the erivan khanate the nakhchivan khanate and the remainder of the lankaran khanate comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary azerbaijani republic that were still in iranian hands after incorporation of all caucasian territories from iran into russia the new border between the two was set at the aras river which upon the soviet union disintegration subsequently became part of the border between iran and the azerbaijan republic qajar iran was forced to cede its caucasian territories to russia in the th century which thus included the territory of the modern day azerbaijan republic while as result of that cession the azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations iran and azerbaijan nevertheless the number of ethnic azerbaijanis in iran far outnumber those in neighboring azerbaijan after the collapse of the russian empire during world war the short lived transcaucasian democratic federative republic was declared constituting the present day republics of azerbaijan georgia and armenia it was followed by the march days massacres that took place between march and april in the city of baku and adjacent areas of the baku governorate of the russian empire when the republic dissolved in may the leading musavat party declared independence as the azerbaijan democratic republic adr adopting the name of azerbaijan for the new republic name that prior to the proclamation of the adr was solely used to refer to the adjacent northwestern region of contemporary iran the adr was the first modern parliamentary republic in the muslim world among the important accomplishments of the parliament was the extension of suffrage to women making azerbaijan the first muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men another important accomplishment of adr was the establishment of baku state university which was the first modern type university founded in the muslim east paris peace conference by march it was obvious that soviet russia would attack baku vladimir lenin said that the invasion was justified as soviet russia could not survive without baku oil independent azerbaijan lasted only months until the bolshevik th soviet red army invaded it establishing the azerbaijan ssr on april although the bulk of the newly formed azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an armenian revolt that had just broken out in karabakh azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of quickly or easily as many as azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively russian reconquest on october the soviet republics of russia armenia azerbaijan and georgia signed an agreement with turkey known as the treaty of kars the previously independent republic of aras would also become the nakhichevan autonomous soviet socialist republic within the azerbaijan ssr by the treaty of kars on the other hand armenia was awarded the region of zangezur and turkey agreed to return gyumri then known as alexandropol during world war ii azerbaijan played crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the soviet union with percent of the soviet union oil on the eastern front being supplied by baku by the decree of the supreme soviet of the ussr in february the commitment of more than workers and employees of the oil industry of azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals operation edelweiss carried out by the german wehrmacht targeted baku because of its importance as the energy petroleum

soviet union independence red army paratroops during the black january tragedy in following the politics of glasnost initiated by mikhail gorbachev civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the soviet union including nagorno karabakh an autonomous region of the azerbaijan ssr the disturbances in azerbaijan in response to moscow indifference to an already heated conflict resulted in calls for independence and secession which culminated in the black january events in baku later in the supreme council of the azerbaijan ssr dropped the words soviet socialist from the title adopted the declaration of sovereignty of the azerbaijan republic and restored the flag of the azerbaijan democratic republic as the state flag as consequence of the failed coup which occurred in august in moscow on october the supreme council of azerbaijan adopted declaration of independence which was affirmed by nationwide referendum in december while the soviet union officially ceased to exist on december the country now celebrates its independence day on october the early years of independence were overshadowed by the first nagorno karabakh war with the ethnic armenian majority of nagorno karabakh backed by armenia by the end of the hostilities in armenians controlled up to percent of azerbaijani territory including nagorno karabakh itself during the war many atrocities were committed including the massacres at malibeyli and gushchular the garadaghly massacre the agdaban and the khojaly massacres furthermore an estimated people have been killed and more than million

first countries involved in cinematography therefore it is not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in baku at the start of the th century this bay town on the caspian was producing more than percent of the world supply of oil just like today the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work in during the azerbaijan democratic republic documentary the celebration of the anniversary of azerbaijani independence was filmed on the first anniversary of azerbaijan independence from russia may and premiered in june at several theatres in baku after the soviet power was established in nariman narimanov chairman of the revolutionary committee of azerbaijan signed decree nationalizing azerbaijan cinema this also influenced the creation of azerbaijani animation in after azerbaijan gained its independence from the soviet union the first baku international film festival east west was held in baku in december the former president of azerbaijan heydar aliyev signed decree proclaiming august to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of azerbaijan today azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by prior to the establishment of the soviet union in once again both choices of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker television there are three state owned television channels aztv

the co founder of nida civic movement was sentenced to years of imprisonment on may the constitution of azerbaijan claims to guarantee freedom of speech but this is denied in practice after several years of decline in press and media freedom in the media environment in azerbaijan deteriorated rapidly under governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism even while the country led the committee of ministers of the council of europe may november spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm all foreign broadcasts are banned in the country according to the freedom house freedom of the press report azerbaijan press freedom status is not free and azerbaijan ranks th out of countries christianity is officially recognized but in practice it is often oppressed all religious communities are required to register to be allowed to meet under the risk of imprisonment this registration is often denied racial discrimination contributes to the country lack of religious freedom since many of the christians are ethnic armenian or russian rather than azeri muslim radio free europe radio liberty and voice of america are banned in azerbaijan discrimination against lgbt people in azerbaijan is widespread during the last few years three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations azerbaijan had the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in europe in according to the committee to protect journalists and is the th most censored country in the world ahead of iran and china some critical journalists have been arrested for their coverage of the covid pandemic in azerbaijan report by an amnesty international researcher in october points to the severe deterioration of human rights in azerbaijan over the past few years sadly azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in the process almost wipe out its civil society amnesty annual report on the country stated persecution of political dissent continued human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work at least prisoners of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both in the country and abroad while their family members also faced harassment and arrests international human rights monitors were barred and expelled from the country reports of torture and other ill treatment persisted the guardian reported in april that azerbaijan ruling elite operated secret bn bn scheme to pay prominent europeans buy luxury goods and launder money through network of opaque british companies leaked data shows that the azerbaijani leadership accused of serial human rights abuses systemic corruption and rigging elections made more than covert payments from to some of this money went to politicians and journalists as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of azerbaijan president ilham aliyev and to promote positive image of his oil rich country there was no suggestion that all recipients were aware of the source of the money as it arrived via disguised route sport freestyle wrestling has been traditionally regarded as azerbaijan national sport in which azerbaijan won up to fourteen medals including four golds since joining the international olympic committee currently the most popular sports include football and wrestling football is the most popular sport in azerbaijan and the association of football federations of azerbaijan with registered players is the largest sporting association in the country the national football team of azerbaijan demonstrates relatively low performance in the international arena compared to the nation football clubs the most successful azerbaijani football clubs are neftchi baku qarabağ and gabala in neftchi baku became the first azerbaijani team to advance to the group stage of european competition beating apoel of cyprus on aggregate in the play off round of the uefa europa league in qarabağ became the second azerbaijani club advancing to the group stage of uefa europa league in after beating copenhagen in the play off round of the uefa champions league qarabağ became the first azerbaijani club to reach the group stage futsal is another popular sport in azerbaijan the azerbaijan national futsal team reached fourth place in the uefa futsal championship while domestic club araz naxçivan clinched bronze medals at the uefa futsal cup and uefa futsal cup azerbaijan was the main sponsor of spanish football club atlético de madrid during seasons and partnership that the club described should promote the image of

perseid meteor shower amateur astronomy is hobby where participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye binoculars or telescopes even though scientific research may not be their primary goal some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing citizen science such as by monitoring variable stars double stars sunspots or occultations of stars by the moon or asteroids or by discovering transient astronomical events such as comets galactic novae or supernovae in other galaxies amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support and usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject most amateurs are hobbyists while others have high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers many astronomers have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework however since the beginning of the twentieth century professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible but others observe during the daytime by viewing the sun and solar eclipses some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories amateurs can also join as members of amateur astronomical societies which can advise educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects they can also promote the science of astronomy among the general public objectives an image of the cat paw nebula created combining the work of professional and amateur astronomers the image is the combination of the metre mpg eso telescope of the la silla observatory in chile and meter amateur telescope collectively amateur astronomers observe variety of celestial objects and phenomena common targets of amateur astronomers include the sun the moon planets stars comets meteor showers and variety of deep sky objects such as star clusters galaxies and nebulae many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects types of objects or types of events which interest them one branch of amateur astronomy amateur involves the taking of photos of the night sky has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including digital cameras dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality ccd cameras most amateur astronomers work at visible wavelengths but small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum an early pioneer of radio astronomy was grote reber an amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built radio telescope in the late to follow up on the discovery of radio wavelength emissions from space by karl jansky non visual amateur astronomy includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes and also the use of radio telescopes some amateur astronomers use home made radio telescopes while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs the one mile telescope is one such example common tools places like paranal observatory offer crystal clear skies for observing astronomical objects with or without instruments amateur astronomers use range of instruments to study the sky depending on combination of their interests and resources methods include simply looking at the night sky with the naked eye using binoculars and using variety of optical telescopes of varying power and quality as well as additional sophisticated equipment such as cameras to study light from the sky in both the visual and non visual parts of the spectrum commercial telescopes are available new and used but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build or commission the building of their own custom telescopes some people even focus on amateur telescope making as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks binoculars for instance although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes also tend to provide wider field of view which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky amateur astronomers also use star charts that depending on experience and intentions may range from simple planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers including software that generates maps of the sky software to assist with observation scheduling software and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations which usually takes the form of an observing log observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when as well as describing the details that were seen sketching is sometimes used within logs and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times the information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings although not professional information or credible it is way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences the popularity of imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy the buying and selling of equipment occurs online many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions using tools such as the clear sky chart common techniques while number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye sometimes with the aid of star chart many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them although many methods are used in amateur astronomy most are variations of few specific techniques star hopping star hopping is method often used by amateur astronomers with low tech equipment such as binoculars or manually driven telescope it involves the use of maps or memory to locate known landmark stars and hopping between them often with the aid of finderscope because of its simplicity star hopping is very common method for finding objects that are close to naked eye stars more advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include telescope mounts with setting circles which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest and goto telescopes which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand having first been calibrated mobile apps the advent of mobile applications for use in smartphones has led to the creation of many dedicated apps these apps allow any user to easily locate celestial objects of interest by simply pointing the smartphone device in that direction in the sky these apps make use of the inbuilt hardware in the phone such as gps location and gyroscope useful information about the pointed object like celestial coordinates the name of the object its constellation etc are provided for quick reference some paid versions give more information these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing for the alignment process of telescopes setting circles setting circles are angular measurement scales that can be placed on the two main rotation axes of some telescopes since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an analog setting circle asc by knowing the coordinates of an object usually given in equatorial coordinates the telescope user can use the setting circle to align point the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its eyepiece computerized setting circle is called digital setting circle dsc although digital setting circles can be used to display telescope ra and dec coordinates they are not simply digital read out of what can be seen on the telescope analog setting circles as with go to telescopes digital setting circle computers commercial names include argo navis sky commander and ngc max contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions to find celestial object in telescope equipped with dsc computer one does not need to look up the specific ra and dec coordinates in book or other resource and then adjust the telescope to those numerical readings rather the object is chosen from the electronic database which causes distance values and arrow markers to appear in the display that indicate the distance and direction to move the telescope the telescope is moved until the two angular distance values reach zero indicating that the telescope is properly aligned when both the ra and dec axes are thus zeroed out the object should be in the eyepiece many dscs like go to systems can also work in conjunction with laptop sky programs computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession traditional printed sources are subtitled by the epoch year which refers to the positions of celestial objects at given time to the nearest year most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years computerized sources on the other hand are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the epoch of date to the exact instant of observation goto telescopes goto telescopes have become more popular since the as technology has improved and prices have been reduced with these computer driven telescopes the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on research for example goto telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping allowing more time for studying of the object goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt azimuth telescope mounts allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product goto telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning however several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built in gps decreasing the time it takes to set up telescope at the start of an observing session remote controlled telescopes with the development of fast internet in the last part of the th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and ccd cameras remote telescope astronomy is now viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging this enables anyone to control telescope great distance away in dark location the observer can image through the telescope using ccd cameras the digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the internet an example of digital remote telescope operation for public use via the internet is the bareket observatory and there are telescope farms in new mexico australia and atacama in chile imaging techniques amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including film dslr lrgb and ccd because ccd imagers are linear image processing may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution which has increased the popularity of in urban areas narrowband filters may also be used to minimize light pollution video of the night sky taken with dslr cameras in japan scientific research scientific research is most often not the main goal for many amateur astronomers unlike professional astronomers work of scientific merit is possible however and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data to recognize this the astronomical society of the pacific annually gives amateur achievement awards for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs the majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection in particular this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers several organizations such as the american association of variable star observers and the british astronomical association exist to help coordinate these contributions amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars and supernovae helping to track asteroids and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the moon as seen from earth with more advanced equipment but still cheap in comparison to professional setups amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects which can yield high quality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena kreutz sungrazers in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by earth and space based observatories much of which is available over the internet in the past and present amateur astronomers have played major role in discovering new comets recently however funding of projects such as the lincoln near earth asteroid research and near earth asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them telescope set up in brooklyn bridge park for public stargazing session societies there are large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world that serve as meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy members range from active observers with their own equipment to armchair astronomers who are simply interested in the topic societies range widely in their goals and activities which may depend on variety of factors such as geographic spread local circumstances size and membership for example small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and star parties whereas large one based in major city might have numerous members but be limited by light pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest speakers instead major national or international societies generally publish their own journal or newsletter and some hold large multi day meetings akin to scientific conference or convention they may also have sections devoted to particular topics such as lunar observation or amateur telescope making notable amateur astronomers sir patrick moore was one of the world leading popularisers of astronomy george alcock discovered several comets and novae thomas

is modern japanese martial art developed by morihei ueshiba as synthesis of his martial studies philosophy and religious beliefs ueshiba goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury aikido is often translated as the way of unifying with life energy or as the way of harmonious spirit according to the founder philosophy the primary goal in the practice of aikido is to overcome oneself instead of cultivating violence or aggressiveness morihei ueshiba used the phrase true victory final victory over oneself here and now to refer to this principle mitsuteru ueshiba at the th all japan aikido demonstration held at the nippon budokan may aikido fundamental principles include irimi entering atemi kokyu ho breathing control sankaku ho triangular principle and tenkan turning movements that redirect the opponent attack momentum its curriculum comprises various techniques primarily throws and joint locks it also includes weapons system encompassing the bokken tantō and jō aikido derives mainly from the martial art of daitō ryū aiki jūjutsu but began to diverge from it in the late partly due to ueshiba involvement with the ōmoto kyō religion ueshiba early students documents bear the term aiki jūjutsu ueshiba senior students have different approaches to aikido depending partly on when they studied with him today aikido is found all over the world in number of styles with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis however they all share techniques formulated by ueshiba and most have concern for the well being of the attacker etymology and basic philosophy ki in its old character form the word aikido is formed of three kanji ai harmony unifying ki energy spirit dō way path the term aiki does not readily appear in the japanese language outside the scope of budō this has led to many possible interpretations of the word is mainly used in compounds to mean combine unite join together meet examples being combined united composition unite combine join together union alliance association combine unify and mutual agreement there is an idea of reciprocity to get to know one another talk discussion negotiation and meet by appointment is often used to describe feeling or emotive action as in feel as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning and feeling sensation it is used to mean energy or force as in electricity and magnetism it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things as in spirit trait temperament the characters aeteological history can be traced back to the much older chinese character of qi that is used extensively in traditional chinese medicine and acupunture the term in aikido is derived from the word tao in chinese and is found in many other japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo and in various non martial arts such as japanese calligraphy flower arranging and tea ceremony therefore from purely literal interpretation aikido is the way of combining forces or way of unifying energy in which the term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort one applies by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply counter technique history ueshiba in tokyo in aikido was created by morihei ueshiba referred to by some aikido practitioners as great teacher the term aikido was coined in the twentieth century ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation during ueshiba lifetime and continuing today aikido has evolved from the aiki that ueshiba studied into variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world initial development takeda sōkaku ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late through the through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied the core martial art from which aikido derives is daitō ryū aiki jūjutsu which ueshiba studied directly with takeda sōkaku the reviver of that art additionally ueshiba is known to have studied tenjin shin yō ryū with tozawa tokusaburō in tokyo in gotōha yagyū shingan ryū under nakai masakatsu in sakai from to and judo with kiyoichi takagi in tanabe in the art of daitō ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido along with empty handed throwing and joint locking techniques ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons such as those for the spear short staff and possibly the aikido also derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ueshiba moved to hokkaidō in and began studying under takeda sokaku in his official association with daitō ryū continued until however during the latter part of that period ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from takeda and the daitō ryū at that time ueshiba referred to his martial art as aiki budō it is unclear exactly when ueshiba began using the name aikido but it became the official name of the art in when the greater japan martial virtue society was engaged in government sponsored reorganization and centralization of japanese martial arts religious influences onisaburo deguchi after ueshiba left hokkaidō in he met and was profoundly influenced by onisaburo deguchi the spiritual leader of the ōmoto kyō religion neo shinto movement in ayabe one of the primary features of ōmoto kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one life this idea was great influence on ueshiba martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it in an ideal resolution not only is the receiver unharmed but so is the attacker in addition to the effect on his spiritual growth the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as martial artist as result of this exposure he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students several of these students would found their own styles of aikido international dissemination aikido was first introduced to the rest of the world in by minoru mochizuki with visit to france where he demonstrated aikido techniques to judo students he was followed by tadashi abe in who came as the official aikikai hombu representative remaining in france for seven years kenji tomiki toured with delegation of various martial arts through continental states of the united states in later that year koichi tohei was sent by aikikai hombu to hawaii for full year where he set up several dōjō this trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united states the united kingdom followed in italy in by hiroshi tada and germany in by katsuaki asai designated the official delegate for europe and africa by morihei ueshiba masamichi noro arrived in france in september seiichi sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to australia in today there are aikido dōjō throughout the world proliferation of independent organizations the largest aikido organization is the aikikai foundation which remains under the control of the ueshiba family however aikido has developed into many styles most of which were formed by morihei ueshiba major students the earliest independent styles to emerge were yoseikan aikido begun by minoru mochizuki in yoshinkan aikido founded by gozo shioda in and shodokan aikido founded by kenji tomiki in the emergence of these styles pre dated ueshiba death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized shodokan aikido however was controversial since it introduced unique rule based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido after ueshiba death in two more major styles emerged significant controversy arose with the departure of the aikikai hombu dojo chief instructor koichi tohei in tohei left as result of disagreement with the son of the founder kisshomaru ueshiba who at that time headed the aikikai foundation the disagreement was over the proper role of ki development in regular aikido training after tohei left he formed his own style called shin shin toitsu aikido and the organization that governs it the ki society ki no kenkyūkai final major style evolved from ueshiba retirement in iwama ibaraki and the teaching methodology of long term student morihiro saito it is unofficially referred to as the iwama style and at one point number of its followers formed loose network of schools they called iwama ryu although iwama style practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saito death in followers of saito subsequently split into two groups one remained with the aikikai and the other formed the independent shinshin aikishuren kai in around saito son hitohiro saito today the major styles of aikido are each run by separate governing organization have their own in japan and are taught throughout the world ki this was the kanji for ki until when it was changed to the study of ki is an important component of aikido the term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training as it encompasses both the kanji for ki was written in its older form as up until the japanese governmental writing reforms after world war ii and now is more prevalently seen in its modern form of this form has the removal of the eight directions denoting the pre and post natal energies of genki 元氣 chinese yuán qì also known in the art of aikido as source energy the character for ki is used in everyday japanese terms such as or ki has many meanings including ambience mind mood or intention and action however in traditional martial arts and medicine it is often referred to in its more general terminology as life energy gozo shioda yoshinkan aikido considered one of the hard styles largely follows ueshiba teachings from before world war ii and surmises that the secret to ki lies in timing and the application of the whole body strength to single point in later years ueshiba application of ki in aikido took on softer more gentle feel this concept was known as takemusu aiki and many of his later students teach about ki from this perspective koichi tohei ki society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical albeit subjective experience of ki with students proficiency in aikido techniques and ki development ranked separately training in aikido as in virtually all japanese martial arts there are both physical and mental aspects of training the physical training in aikido is diverse covering both general physical fitness and conditioning as well as specific techniques because substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws beginners learn how to safely fall or roll the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins after basic techniques are learned students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents and techniques with weapons fitness ukemi is very important for safe practice physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders flexibility and endurance with less emphasis on strength training in aikido pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements this distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner in aikido specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone mass or power aikido related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates for example many dōjōs begin each class with which may include stretching and ukemi break falls roles of uke and tori aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre arranged forms kata rather than freestyle practice the basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique uke to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique the tori or shite depending on aikido style also referred to as nage when applying throwing technique who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique both halves of the technique that of uke and that of tori are considered essential to aikido training both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous off balance positions in which tori places them this receiving of the technique is called ukemi uke continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities an exposed side while tori uses position and timing to keep uke off balance and vulnerable in more advanced training uke will sometimes apply to regain balance and pin or throw tori refers to the act of receiving technique good ukemi involves attention to the technique the partner and the immediate environment it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido the method of falling itself is also important and is way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury initial attacks aikido techniques are usually defense against an attack so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with partner although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking based arts attacks with intent such as strong strike or an immobilizing grab are needed to study correct and effective application of technique many of the of aikido resemble cuts from sword or other grasped object which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat other techniques which explicitly appear to be punches tsuki are practiced as thrusts with knife or sword kicks are generally reserved for upper level variations reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous and that kicks high kicks in particular were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal japan some basic strikes include is vertical knifehand strike to the head in training this is usually directed at the forehead or the crown for safety but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the maxillary sinus is diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck is punch to the torso specific targets include the chest abdomen and solar plexus sometimes referred to as or is punch to the face sometimes referred to as beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of hold than it is for strike some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw weapon whereupon technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender the following are examples of some basic grabs when one hand grabs one wrist when both hands grab one wrist sometimes referred to as when both hands grab both wrists sometimes referred to as when one shoulder is grabbed when both shoulders are grabbed it is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as when the lapel is grabbed sometimes referred to as basic techniques ikkyo first principle established between the founder sensei morihei ueshiba 植芝 盛平 december april and andré nocquet july march disciple diagram of ikkyō or first technique yonkyō has similar mechanism of action although the upper hand grips the forearm rather than the elbow the following are sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins many of these techniques derive from daitō ryū aiki jūjutsu but some others were invented by morihei ueshiba the precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles the following are the terms used by the aikikai foundation note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed they are not universally taught in numeric order control technique using one hand on the elbow and one hand near the wrist which leverages uke to the ground this grip applies pressure into the ulnar nerve at the wrist is pronating wristlock that torques the arm and applies painful nerve pressure there is an adductive wristlock or lock in the ura version is rotational wristlock that directs upward spiraling tension throughout the arm elbow and shoulder is shoulder control technique similar to ikkyō but with both hands gripping the forearm the knuckles from the palm side are applied to the recipient radial nerve against the periosteum of the forearm bone is technique that is visually similar to ikkyō but with an inverted grip of the wrist medial rotation of the arm and shoulder and downward pressure on the elbow common in knife and other weapon take aways is throw during which uke hand is folded back past the shoulder locking the shoulder joint is supinating wristlock throw that stretches the extensor digitorum is loosely used umbrella term for various types of mechanically unrelated techniques kokyūnage generally do not use joint locks like other techniques throws in which tori moves through the space occupied by uke the classic form superficially resembles clothesline technique throw in which beginning with ryōte dori moving forward tori sweeps one hand low earth and the other high heaven which unbalances uke so that he or she easily topples over aikido version of the hip throw tori drops their hips lower than those of uke then flips uke over the resultant fulcrum or throw that locks the arms against each other the kanji for is cross shape is throw in which tori sweeps uke arm back until it locks the shoulder joint then uses forward pressure to throw them implementations diagram showing two versions of the ikkyō technique one moving forward the omote version and one moving backward the ura version see text for more details aikido makes use of body movement tai sabaki to blend the movement of tori with the movement of uke for example an entering irimi technique consists of movements inward towards uke while technique uses pivoting motion additionally an technique takes place in front of uke whereas an technique takes place to their side technique is applied with motion to the front of uke and version is applied with motion towards the rear of uke usually by incorporating turning or pivoting motion finally most techniques can be performed while in seated posture seiza techniques where both uke and tori are standing are called tachi waza techniques where both start off in seiza are called suwari waza and techniques performed with uke standing and tori sitting are called hanmi handachi from these few basic techniques there are numerous of possible implementations for example ikkyō can be applied to an opponent moving forward with strike perhaps with an ura type of movement to redirect the incoming force or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance perhaps an omote waza version specific aikido kata are typically referred to with the formula attack technique modifier katate dori ikkyō for example refers to any ikkyō technique executed when uke is holding one wrist this could be further specified as katate dori ikkyō omote referring to any forward moving ikkyō technique from that grab atemi are strikes or feints employed during an aikido technique some view atemi as attacks against vital points meant to cause damage in and of themselves for instance gozo shioda described using atemi in brawl to quickly down gang leader others consider atemi especially to the face to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques strike even if it is blocked can startle the target and break their concentration additionally the target may also become unbalanced while attempting to avoid strike by jerking the head back for example which may allow for an easier throw many sayings about atemi are attributed to morihei ueshiba who considered them an essential element of technique weapons disarming an attacker using technique weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff jō these techniques closely resemble the use of the bayonet or jūkendō the wooden sword bokken and the knife tantō some schools incorporate firearm disarming techniques where either weapon taking and or weapon retention may be taught some schools such as the iwama style of morihiro saito usually spend substantial time practicing with both bokken and jō under the names of aiki ken and aiki jō respectively the founder developed many of the empty handed techniques from traditional sword spear and bayonet movements consequently the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements and reinforces the concepts of distance timing foot movement presence and connectedness with one training partner multiple attackers and randori one feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers often called taninzudori or taninzugake freestyle practice with multiple attackers called randori is key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks randori exercises person ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment strategic choice of techniques based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers is important in randori training for instance an ura technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind in shodokan aikido randori differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker but between two people where both participants attack defend and counter at will in this respect it resembles judo randori injuries in applying technique during training it is the responsibility of tori to prevent injury to uke by employing speed and force of application that is appropriate with their partner proficiency in ukemi when injuries especially to the joints occur they are often the result of tori misjudging the ability of uke to receive the throw or pin study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers and toes several deaths from head and neck injuries caused by aggressive shihōnage in senpai kōhai hazing context have been reported mental training aikido training is mental as well as physical emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations this is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the enter and blend movements that underlie aikido techniques wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness morihei ueshiba once remarked that one must be willing to receive of an opponent attack and stare death in the face in order to execute techniques without hesitation as martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners uniforms and ranking hakama are folded after practice to preserve the pleats aikido practitioners commonly called aikidōka outside japan generally progress by promotion through series of grades kyū followed by series of degrees dan pursuant to formal testing procedures some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners grades often simply white and black belts to distinguish kyu and dan grades though some use various belt colors testing requirements vary so particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another some dōjōs have an age requirement before students can take the dan rank exam rank belt color type kyū px white mudansha yūkyūsha dan px black yūdansha the uniform worn for practicing aikido aikidōgi is similar to the training uniform keikogi used in most other modern martial arts simple trousers and wraparound jacket usually white both thick judo style and thin karate style cotton tops are used aikido specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow most aikido systems add pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called hakama used also in naginatajutsu kendo and iaido in many schools its use is reserved for practitioners with dan ranks or for instructors while others allow all practitioners to wear hakama regardless of rank criticisms the most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from lack of realism in training the attacks initiated by uke and which tori must defend against have been criticized as being weak sloppy and little more than caricatures of an attack weak attacks from uke allow for conditioned response from tori and result in of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners to counteract this some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but in keeping with the core philosophies this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners shodokan aikido addresses the issue by practising in competitive format such adaptations are debated between styles with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified or that they are not training for self defense or combat effectiveness but spiritual fitness or other reasons mixed martial arts analyst jack slack has written but if you want me to write aikido off as one hundred percent nonsense about to disappoint you once you strip away the cult like hierarchy of throwing oneself through the air for sensei aikido contains good number of mechanically sound techniques and principles however mechanically sound doesn mean practical yet brazilian jiu jitsu practitioners note that while aikido has an excellent variety of ukemi breakfalls techniques aikido non controling of the opponent body while applying submission is unrealistic another criticism pertains to the shift in training focus after the end of ueshiba seclusion in iwama from to the mid as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido as result strikes to vital points by tori entering irimi and initiation of techniques by tori the distinction between omote front side and ura back side techniques and the use of weapons were all de emphasized or eliminated from practice some aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness conversely some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by ueshiba according to minoru shibata of aikido journal sensei aikido was not continuation and extension of the old and has distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts that is that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido roots in traditional jujutsu or kenjutsu are diverging from what ueshiba taught such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that ueshiba transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals of the paradigm that he demonstrated references external links aikiweb aikido information site on aikido with essays forums gallery reviews columns wiki and

range of human activities involving the creation of visual auditory or performing artifacts artworks which express the creator imagination conceptual ideas or technical skill intended to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power other activities related to the production of works of art include art criticism and the history of art the three classical branches of visual art are painting sculpture and architecture music theatre film dance and other performing arts as well as literature and other media such as interactive media are included in broader definition of the arts until the th century art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences in modern usage after the th century where aesthetic considerations are paramount the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general such as the decorative or applied arts though there is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art and ideas have changed over time general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation the nature of art and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation are explored in branch of philosophy known as aesthetics overview in the perspective of the history of art artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early pre historic art to contemporary art however some theorists feel that the typical concept of artistic works fits less well outside modern western societies one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning which roughly translates to skill or craft as associated with words such as artisan english words derived from this meaning include artifact artificial artifice medical arts and military arts however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymology th century bottle twa peoples rwanda artistic works may serve practical functions in addition to their decorative value over time philosophers like plato aristotle socrates and kant among others questioned the meaning of art several dialogues in plato tackle questions about art socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational he speaks approvingly of this and other forms of divine madness drunkenness eroticism and dreaming in the phaedrus and yet in the republic wants to outlaw homer great poetic art and laughter as well in ion socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of homer that he expresses in the republic the dialogue ion suggests that homer iliad functioned in the ancient greek world as the bible does today in the modern christian world as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance if only it can be properly interpreted with regards to the literary art and the musical arts aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art each varying in imitation by medium object and manner for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind advantages over animals the more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early th century fine art refers to skill used to express the artist creativity or to engage the audience aesthetic sensibilities or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art within this latter sense the word art may refer to several things study of creative skill ii process of using the creative skill iii product of the creative skill or iv the audience experience with the creative skill the creative arts art as discipline are collection of disciplines which produce artworks art as objects that are compelled by personal drive art as activity and convey message mood or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret art as experience art is something that stimulates an individual thoughts emotions beliefs or ideas through the senses works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects for some scholars such as kant the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression often if the skill is being used in common or practical way people will consider it craft instead of art likewise if the skill is being used in commercial or industrial way it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art on the other hand crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference however even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self expression the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically spiritually or philosophically motivated art to create sense of beauty see aesthetics to explore the nature of perception for pleasure or to generate strong emotions the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent the nature of art has been described by philosopher richard wollheim as one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture art has been defined as vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake and as mimesis or representation art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of aristotle leo tolstoy identified art as use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another benedetto croce and collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator the theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of kant and was developed in the early th century by roger fry and clive bell more recently thinkers influenced by martin heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which community develops for itself medium for self expression and interpretation george dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines work of art as any artifact upon which qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as the art world has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation larry shiner has described fine art as not an essence or fate but something we have made art as we have generally understood it is european invention barely two hundred years old art may be characterized in terms of mimesis its representation of reality narrative storytelling expression communication of emotion or other qualities during the romantic period art came to be seen as special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science history venus of willendorf circa bp back of renaissance oval basin or dish in the metropolitan museum of art the oldest documented forms of art are visual arts which include creation of images or objects in fields including today painting sculpture printmaking photography and other visual media sculptures cave paintings rock paintings and petroglyphs from the upper paleolithic dating

from the lascaux caves circa bp many great traditions in art have foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations ancient egypt mesopotamia persia india china ancient greece rome as well as inca maya and olmec each of these centers of early civilization developed unique and characteristic style in its art because of the size and duration of these civilizations more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times some also have provided the first records of how artists worked for example this period of greek art saw veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature poise beauty and anatomically correct proportions in byzantine and medieval art of the western middle ages much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture and used styles that showed the higher glory of heavenly world such as the use of gold in the background of paintings or glass in mosaics or windows which also presented figures in idealized patterned flat forms nevertheless classical realist tradition persisted in small byzantine works and realism steadily grew in the art of catholic europe renaissance art had greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world and the place of humans in it reflected in the corporeality of the human body and development of systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in three dimensional picture space the stylized signature of sultan mahmud ii of the ottoman empire was written in islamic calligraphy it reads mahmud khan son of abdulhamid is forever victorious great mosque of kairouan in tunisia also called the mosque of uqba is one of the finest most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques dated in its present state from the th century it is the ancestor and model of all the mosques in the western islamic lands in the east islamic art rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns calligraphy and architecture further east religion dominated artistic styles and forms too india and tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines china saw the flourishing of many art forms jade carving bronzework pottery including the stunning terracotta army of emperor qin poetry calligraphy music painting drama fiction etc chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty so for example tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse emphasizing idealized landscapes but ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful and focus on telling stories via setting and composition japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting woodblock printing became important in japan after the th century painting by song dynasty artist ma lin circa cm the western age of enlightenment in the th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe as well as politically revolutionary visions of post monarchist world such as blake portrayal of newton as divine geometer or david propagandistic paintings this led to romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans exemplified in the novels of goethe the late th century then saw host of artistic movements such as academic art symbolism impressionism and fauvism among others the history of th century art is narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards each being torn down in succession by the next thus the parameters of impressionism expressionism fauvism cubism dadaism surrealism etc cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into western art thus japanese woodblock prints themselves influenced by western renaissance draftsmanship had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development later african sculptures were taken up by picasso and to some extent by matisse similarly in the th and th centuries the west has had huge impacts on eastern art with originally western ideas like communism and post modernism exerting powerful influence modernism the idealistic search for truth gave way in the latter half of the th century to realization of its unattainability theodor adorno said in it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more neither art itself nor art in relationship to the whole nor even the right of art to exist relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of global culture rather than of regional ones in the origin of the work of art martin heidegger german philosopher and seminal thinker describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth he argues that art is not only way of expressing the element of truth in culture but the means of creating it and providing springboard from which that which is can be revealed works of art are not merely representations of the way things are but actually produce community shared understanding each time new artwork is added to any culture the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed forms genres media and styles napoleon on his imperial throne by ingres french oil on canvas the creative arts are often divided into more specific categories typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media genre styles and form art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance it covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork primarily non semantic aspects of the work figurae such as color contour dimension medium melody space texture and value form may also include visual design principles such as arrangement balance contrast emphasis harmony proportion proximity and rhythm in general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art focusing respectively on form content and context extreme formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal that is part of the art form philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials techniques and form unfortunately there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties some authors refer to subject matter and content denotations and connotations while others prefer terms like meaning and significance extreme intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays decisive role in the meaning of work of art conveying the content or essential main idea while all other interpretations can be discarded it defines the subject as the persons or idea represented and the content as the artist experience of that subject for example the composition of napoleon on his imperial throne is partly borrowed from the statue of zeus at olympia as evidenced by the title the subject is napoleon and the content is ingres representation of napoleon as emperor god beyond time and space similarly to extreme formalism philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant its restrictive interpretation is socially unhealthy philosophically unreal and politically unwise finally the developing theory of post structuralism studies art significance in cultural context such as the ideas emotions and reactions prompted by work the cultural context often reduces to the artist techniques and intentions in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism however in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate such as religious and philosophical convictions sociopolitical and economic structures or even climate and geography art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art skill and craft the creation of adam detail from michelangelo fresco in the sistine chapel art can connote sense of trained ability or mastery of medium art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings thoughts and observations there is an understanding that is reached with the material as result of handling it which facilitates one thought processes common view is that the epithet art particular in its elevated sense requires certain level of creative expertise by the artist whether this be demonstration of technical ability an originality in stylistic approach or combination of these two traditionally skill of execution was viewed as quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success for leonardo da vinci art neither more nor less than his other endeavors was manifestation of skill rembrandt work now praised for its ephemeral virtues was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity at the turn of the th century the adroit performances of john singer sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast pablo picasso was completing traditional academic training at which he excelled detail of leonardo da vinci mona lisa showing the painting technique of sfumato common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object in conceptual art marcel duchamp fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ready made and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills tracey emin my bed or damien hirst the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media emin slept and engaged in other activities in her bed before placing the result in gallery as work of art hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans hirst celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts the actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is matter of assembly of found objects however there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands on works of art purpose navajo rug made circa mozarabic beatus miniature spain late th century art has had great number of different functions throughout its history making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept this does not imply that the purpose of art is vague but that it has had many unique different reasons for being created some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline the different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non motivated and those that are motivated lévi strauss non motivated functions the non motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human transcend the individual or do not fulfill specific external purpose in this sense art as creativity is something humans must do by their very nature no other species creates art and is therefore beyond utility basic human instinct for harmony balance rhythm art at this level is not an action or an object but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony beauty and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility imitation then is one instinct of our nature next there is the instinct for harmony and rhythm meters being manifestly sections of rhythm persons therefore starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes till their rude improvisations gave birth to poetry aristotle experience of the mysterious art provides way to experience one self in relation to the universe this experience may often come unmotivated as one appreciates art music or poetry the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and science albert einstein expression of the imagination art provides means to express the imagination in non grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language unlike words which come in sequences and each of which have definite meaning art provides range of forms symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable jupiter eagle as an example of art is not like logical aesthetic attributes of an object the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation but rather something else something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in concept determined by words they furnish an aesthetic idea which serves the above rational idea as substitute for logical presentation but with the proper function however of animating the mind by opening out for it prospect into field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken immanuel kant ritualistic and symbolic functions in many cultures art is used in rituals performances and dances as decoration or symbol while these often have no specific utilitarian motivated purpose anthropologists know that they often serve purpose at the level of meaning within particular culture this meaning is not furnished by any one individual but is often the result of many generations of change and of cosmological relationship within the culture most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative ritual or symbolic are aware of the trap posed by the term art silva tomaskova motivated functions motivated purposes of art refer to intentional conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator these may be to bring about political change to comment on an aspect of society to convey specific emotion or mood to address personal psychology to illustrate another discipline to with commercial arts sell product or simply as form of communication communication art at its simplest is form of communication as most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual this is motivated purpose illustrative arts such as scientific illustration are form of art as communication maps are another example however the content need not be scientific emotions moods and feelings are also communicated through art art is set of artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as means of communication steve mithen art as entertainment art may seek to bring about particular emotion or mood for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer this is often the function of the art industries of motion pictures and video games the avant garde art for political change one of the defining functions of early th century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change art movements that had this goal dadaism surrealism russian constructivism and abstract expressionism among others are collectively referred to as the avant garde arts by contrast the realistic attitude inspired by positivism from saint thomas aquinas to anatole france clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement loathe it for it is made up of mediocrity hate and dull conceit it is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books these insulting plays it constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes clarity bordering on stupidity dog life andré breton surrealism art as free zone removed from the action of the social censure unlike the avant garde movements which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values contemporary art has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions social inquiry activism subversion deconstruction becoming more open place for research and experimentation art for social inquiry subversion or anarchy while similar to art for political change subversive or art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal in this case the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society spray paint graffiti on wall in rome graffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls buildings buses trains and bridges usually without permission certain art forms such as graffiti may also be illegal when they break laws in this case vandalism art for social causes art can be used to raise awareness for large variety of causes number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism cancer human trafficking and variety of other topics such as ocean conservation human rights in darfur murdered and missing aboriginal women elder abuse and pollution trashion using trash to make fashion practiced by artists such as marina debris is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution art for psychological and healing purposes art is also used by art therapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy the diagnostic drawing series for example is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of patient the end product is not the principal goal in this case but rather process of healing through creative acts is sought the resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy art for propaganda or commercialism art is often utilized as form of propaganda and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood in similar way art that tries to sell product also influences mood and emotion in both cases the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into particular emotional or psychological response toward particular idea or object art as fitness indicator it has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment one evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits such as artistic ability and creativity are the human equivalent of the peacock tail the purpose of the male peacock extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females see also fisherian runaway and handicap principle according to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because it attracted mates the functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive as many of them may overlap for example art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell product the movie or video game public access versailles louis le vau opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance cour honneur later copied all over europe since ancient times much of the finest art has represented deliberate display of wealth or power often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society nevertheless there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available in terms of ownership across large parts of society above all in cheap media such as pottery which persists in the ground and perishable media such as textiles and wood in many different cultures the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the americas are found in such wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to social elite though other forms of art may have been reproductive methods such as moulds made mass production easier and were used to bring high quality ancient roman pottery and greek tanagra figurines to very wide market cylinder seals were both artistic and practical and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the ancient near east once coins were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society another important innovation came in the th century in europe when printmaking began with small woodcuts mostly religious that were often very small and hand colored and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes printed books were initially very expensive but fell steadily in price until by the th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries the museum of art in basel switzerland is the oldest public museum of art in the world in the city of basel in switzerland opened the first public museum of art in the world the kunstmuseum basel today its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span from the early th century up to the immediate present its various areas of emphasis give it international standing as one of the most significant museums of its kind these encompass paintings and drawings by artists active in the upper rhine region between and and on the art of the th to st centuries public buildings and monuments secular and religious by their nature normally address the whole of society and visitors as viewers and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public rather than the areas seen only by the priests many areas of royal palaces castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen either by anybody or by those able to pay small price or those wearing the correct clothes regardless of who they were as at the palace of versailles where the appropriate extra accessories silver shoe buckles and sword could be hired from shops outside special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries as with the orleans collection mostly housed in wing of the palais royal in paris which could be visited for most of the th century in italy the art tourism of the grand tour became major industry from the renaissance onwards and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible the british royal collection remains distinct but large donations such as the old royal library were made from it to the british museum established in the uffizi in florence opened entirely as gallery in though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants offices for long time before the building now occupied by the prado in madrid was built before the french revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in vienna munich and other capitals the opening of the musée du louvre during the french revolution in as public museum for much of the former french royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art transferring ownership to republican state but was continuation of trends already well established most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone museums in the united states tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses the metropolitan museum of art in new york city for example was created by john taylor johnston railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum but despite all this at least one of the important functions of art in the st century remains as marker of wealth and social status performance by joseph beuys everyone an artist on the way to the libertarian form of the social organism there have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as status object one of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late and was to create art that could not be bought and sold it is necessary to present something more than mere objects said the major post war german artist joseph beuys this time period saw the rise of such things as performance art video art and conceptual art the idea was that if the artwork was performance that would leave nothing behind or was simply an idea it could not be bought and sold democratic precepts revolving around the idea that work of art is commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid and was reaped throughout the artists broadly identified under the heading of conceptual art substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form have endeavored to undermine the art object qua object in the decades since these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition dvds of video works invitations to exclusive performance art pieces and the objects left over from conceptual pieces many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art the marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it and the artwork remains an upper class activity with the widespread use of dvd recording technology in the early artists and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors controversies théodore géricault raft of the medusa circa art has long been controversial that is to say disliked by some viewers for wide variety of reasons though most pre modern controversies are dimly recorded or completely lost to modern view iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for variety of reasons including religious ones aniconism is general dislike of either all figurative images or often just religious ones and has been thread in many major religions it has been crucial factor in the history of islamic art where depictions of muhammad remain especially controversial much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers parties or other groups artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics though often much less so by wider public the iconographic content of art could cause controversy as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the swoon of the virgin in scenes of the crucifixion of jesus the last judgment by michelangelo was controversial for various reasons including breaches of decorum through nudity and the apollo like pose of christ the content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist but with the advent of romanticism and economic changes in the production of art the artists vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art increasing the incidence of controversies though often reducing their significance strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy théodore géricault raft of the medusa was in part political commentary on recent event édouard manet le déjeuner sur herbe was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time rather than in robes of the antique world john singer sargent madame pierre gautreau madam caused controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman ear lobe considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high society model reputation the gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the th and th centuries led to rolling controversy lasting for over century in the th century pablo picasso guernica used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils to depict the harrowing consequences of contemporary bombing of small ancient basque town leon golub interrogation iii depicts female nude hooded detainee strapped to chair her legs open to reveal her sexual organs surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing andres serrano piss christ is photograph of crucifix sacred to the christian religion and representing christ sacrifice and final suffering submerged in glass of the artist own urine the resulting uproar led to comments in the united states senate about public funding of the arts theory before modernism aesthetics in western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries this concern is largely absent in other traditions of art the aesthetic theorist john ruskin who championed what he saw as the naturalism of turner saw art role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature the definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the th century richard wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art the realist whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view the objectivist whereby it is also an absolute value but is dependent on general human experience and the relativist position whereby it is not an absolute value but depends on and varies with the human experience of different humans arrival of modernism composition with red blue and yellow by piet mondrian dutch the arrival of modernism in the late th century lead to radical break in the conception of the function of art and then again in the late th century with the advent of postmodernism clement greenberg article modernist painting defines modern art as the use of characteristic methods of discipline to criticize the discipline itself greenberg originally applied this idea to the abstract expressionist movement and used it as way to understand and justify flat non illusionistic abstract painting after greenberg several important art theorists emerged such as michael fried clark rosalind krauss linda nochlin and griselda pollock among others though only originally intended as way of understanding specific set of artists greenberg definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the th century and early st century pop artists like andy warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture as well as the art world artists of the and expanded this technique of self criticism beyond high art to all cultural image making including fashion images comics billboards and pornography duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind everything however the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is social construction there is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this in the invention of art cultural history larry shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts fine art he finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system fine art held art to be any skilled human activity for example ancient greek society did not possess the term art but techne techne can be understood neither as art or craft the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history techne included painting sculpting and music but also cooking medicine horsemanship geometry carpentry prophecy and farming etc new criticism and the intentional fallacy following duchamp during the first half of the th century significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art including the literary arts and the visual arts to each other this resulted in the rise of the new criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy at issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art whatever its specific form should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art or if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist in william wimsatt and monroe beardsley published classic and controversial new critical essay entitled the intentional fallacy in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author intention or intended meaning in the analysis of literary work for wimsatt and beardsley the words on the page were all that mattered importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant and potentially distracting in another essay the affective fallacy which served as kind of sister essay to the intentional fallacy wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the reader personal emotional reaction to literary work as valid means of analyzing text this fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader response school of literary theory ironically one of the leading theorists from this school stanley fish was himself trained by new critics fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in his essay literature in the reader as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay the creation of art structuralist and post structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of new criticism beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so called autonomy of art but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms assumption that the artist activities and experience were privileged critical topic these authors contend that anti intentionalists such as formalists hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art so details of the act of creating work though possibly of interest in themselves have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that intentionalists unlike formalists hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works they quote richard wollheim as stating that the task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of but terminating on the work of art itself linguistic turn and its debate the end of the th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy or the innocent eye debate in the philosophy of art this debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition namely the structuralism of ferdinand de saussure and the ensuing movement of in the artist mark tansey created work of art titled the innocent eye as criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the th century influential theorists include judith butler luce irigaray julia kristeva michel foucault and jacques derrida the power of language more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes in art history and historical discourse was explored by hayden white the fact that language is not transparent medium of thought had been stressed by very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of johann georg hamann and wilhelm von humboldt ernst gombrich and nelson goodman in his book languages of art an approach to theory of symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the and he was challenged on the basis of research done by the nobel prize winning psychologist roger sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone the linguistic turn and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable sperry view eventually prevailed by the end of the th century with aesthetic philosophers such as nick zangwill strongly defending return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives classification disputes fountain by marcel duchamp photographed by alfred stieglitz at the after the society of independent artists exhibit stieglitz used backdrop of the warriors by marsden hartley to photograph the urinal the exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen disputes as to whether or not to classify something as work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art classificatory disputes in the th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings duchamp fountain the movies superlative imitations of banknotes conceptual art and video games philosopher david novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem rather the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life are so much part of all classificatory disputes about art according to novitz classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper for example when the daily mail criticized hirst and emin work by arguing for years art has been one of our great civilising forces today pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all they are not advancing definition or theory about art but questioning the value of hirst and emin work in arthur danto suggested thought experiment showing that the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas culture applies to it rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities cultural interpretation an art theory of some kind is therefore constitutive of an object arthood anti art is label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art it is term associated with dadaism and attributed to marcel duchamp just before world war when he was making art from found objects one of these fountain an ordinary urinal has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art anti art is feature of work by situationist international the lo fi mail art movement and the young british artists though it is form still rejected by the stuckists who describe themselves as anti anti art architecture is often included as one of the visual arts however like the decorative arts or advertising it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in way that they usually are not in painting for example value judgment aboriginal hollow log tombs national gallery canberra australia somewhat in relation to the above the word art is also used to apply judgments of value as in such expressions as that meal was work of art the cook is an artist or the art of deception the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised it is this use of the word as measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity making judgments of value requires basis for criticism at the simplest level way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive though perception is always colored by experience and is necessarily subjective it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art however good art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to majority of viewers in other words an artist prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic also art often depicts terrible images made for social moral or thought provoking reasons for example francisco goya painting depicting the spanish shootings of may is graphic depiction of firing squad executing several pleading civilians yet at the same time the horrific imagery demonstrates goya keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction if any is required to define art the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing indeed the reverse is often true that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility and new appreciation for the standards of art itself countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings and can be understood as way of communicating these feelings artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent but they do not have to do so consciously art may be considered an exploration of the human condition that is what it is to be human by extension it has been argued by emily spratt that the development of artificial intelligence especially in regard to its uses with images necessitates re evaluation of aesthetic theory in art history today and reconsideration of the limits of human
